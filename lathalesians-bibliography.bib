It follows that every bounded and continuous valuation on a continuous domain can be extended uniquely to a Borel measure. The result also holds for $\sigma$-finite valuations, but fails for dcpo's in general.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to measurement uncertainty, often, instead of the actual values $x_i$ of the measured quantities, we only know the intervals $\mathbf{x}_i = [\widetilde{x}_i - \Delta_i, \widetilde{x}_i + \Delta_i]$, where $\widetilde{x}_i$ is the measured value and $\Delta_i$ is the upper bound on the measurement error (provided, e.g., by the manufacturer of the measuring instrument). These intervals can be viewed as \emph{random intervals}, i.e., as samples from the interval-valued random variable. In such situations, instead of the exact value of the sample statistics such as covariance $C_{x, y}$, we can only have an interval $\mathbf{C}_{x, y}$ of possible values of this statistic. It is known that in general, computing such an interval $\mathbf{C}_{x, y}$ for $C_{x, y}$ is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that computes this range $\mathbf{C}_{x, y}$ for the case when the measurements are accurate enough --- so that the intervals corresponding to different measurements do not intersect much.},

Retaining the unique approach of the previous editions, this text interweaves material on probability and measure, so that probability problems generate an interest in measure theory and measure theory is then developed and applied to probability. Probability and Measure provides thorough coverage of probability, measure, integration, random variables and expected values, convergence of distributions, derivatives and conditional probability, and stochastic processes. The Third Edition features an improved treatment of Brownian motion and the replacement of queuing theory with ergodic theory.
Like the previous editions, this new edition will be well received by students of mathematics, statistics, economics, and a wide variety of disciplines that require a solid understanding of probability theory.},

  Abstract                 = {If options are correctly priced in the market, it should not be possible to make sure profits by creating portfolios of long and short positions in options and their underlying stocks. Using this principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived. Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of default.},

  Abstract                 = {Two groups of naturally arising questions in the mathematical theory of domains for denotational semantics are addressed. Domains are equipped with Scott topology and represent data types. Scott continuous functions represent computable functions and form the most popular continuous model of computations.
Covariant Logic of Domains: Domains are represented as sets of theories, and Scott continuous functions are represented as input-output inference engines. The questions addressed are: A. What constitutes a subdomain? Do subdomains of a given domain A form a domain? B. Which retractions are finitary? C. What is the essence of generalizations of information systems based on non-reflexive logics? Are these generalizations restricted to continuous domains?
Analysis on Domains: D. How to describe Scott topologies via generalized distance functions satisfying the requirement of Scott continuity (``abstract computability'')? The answer is that the axiom $\rho(x, x) = 0$ is incompatible with Scott continuity of distance functions. The resulting relaxed metrics are studied.
E. Is it possible to obtain Scott continuous relaxed metrics via measures of domain subsets representing positive and negative information about domain elements? The positive answer is obtained via the discovery of the novel class of co-continuous valuations on the systems of Scott open sets.
Some of these natural questions were studied earlier. However, in each case a novel approach is presented, and the answers are supplied with much more compelling and clear justifications, than were known before.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the nonlinear filtering problem for a general Markovian partially observed system (X,Y), whose dynamics is modeled by correlated jump-diffusions having common jump times. At any time t, the sigma-algebra generated by the observation process Y provides all the available information about the signal X. The central goal of stochastic filtering is to characterize the filter which is the conditional distribution of X, given the observed data. It has been proved in Ceci-Colaneri (2012) that the filter is the unique probability measure-valued process satisfying a nonlinear stochastic equation, the so-called Kushner-Stratonovich equation (KS-equation). In this paper the aim is to describe the filter in terms of the unnormalized filter, which is solution to a linear stochastic differential equation, called the Zakai equation. We prove equivalence between strong uniqueness for the solution to the Kushner Stratonovich equation and strong uniqueness for the solution to the Zakai one and, as a consequence, we deduce pathwise uniqueness for the solutions to the Zakai equation by applying the Filtered Martingale Problem approach (Kurtz-Ocone (1988), Kurtz-Nappo (2011), Ceci-Colaneri (2012)). To conclude, we discuss some particular cases.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the convergence analysis of a class of weak approximations of solutions of stochastic differential equations is presented. This class includes recent approximations such as Kusuoka's moment similar families method and the Lyons-Victoir cubature of Wiener Space approach. We show that the rate of convergence depends intrinsically on the smoothness of the chosen test function. For smooth functions (the required degree of smoothness depends on the order of the approximation), an equidistant partition of the time interval on which the approximation is sought is optimal. For functions that are less smooth (for example Lipschitz functions), the rate of convergence decays and the optimal partition is no longer equidistant. Our analysis rests upon Kusuoka-Stroock's results on the smoothness of the distribution of the solution of a stochastic differential equation. Finally the results are applied to the numerical solution of the filtering problem.},

Depending on the intrinsic dimension of the noise, we distinguish two cases: In the first case, the conditional distribution has discrete support and we deduce an explicit representation for the conditional distribution. In the second case, the filtering problem is equivalent to a classical one defined on a manifold and we deduce the evolution equaion of the conditional distribution. The results are applied to the filtering problem where the observation noise in an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process.},

An interval number is used to capture, in a relatively simple manner, features of fuzziness and incompleteness. The vertex method is used for the interval analysis. A new parameter (also an interval number), $\rho$, called the degree of dependence is introduced. The relationship of this interval probability with the theories of Dempster-Shafer, fuzzy sets, and Baldwin's support logic are discussed. The advantage of the theory is that is is based on a development of the axioms of probability, but allows that evidential support for a conjecture be separated from evidential support for the negation of the conjecture.},

  abstract  = {What can computers do in principle? What are their inherent theoretical limitations? These are questions to which computer scientists must address themselves. The theoretical framework which enables such questions to be answered has been developed over the last fifty years from the idea of a computable function: intuitively a function whose values can be calcululated in an effective or automatic way.
This book is an introduction to computability theory (or recursion theory as it is traditionally known to mathematicians). Dr.~Cutland begins with a mathematical characterisation of computable functions (a register machine); after some comparison with other characterisations, he develops the mathematical theory, including a full discussion of non-computability and undecidability, and the theory of recursive and recursively enumerable sets.
The later chapters provide an introduction to more advanced topics such as G\"{o}del's incompleteness theorem, degrees of unsolvability, the Recursion theorems and the theory of complexity of computation. Computability is thus a branch of mathematics which is of relevance also to computer scientists and philosophers. Mathematics students with no prior knowledge of the subject and computer science students who wish to supplement their practical expertise with some theoretical background will find this book of use and interest.},

  Abstract                 = {An element of an effectively given domain is computable iff its basic Scott open neighbourhoods are recursively enumerable. We thus refer to computable elements as Scott computable and define an element to be Lawson computable if its basic Lawson open neighbourhoods are recursively enumerable. Since the Lawson topology is finer than the Scott topology, a stronger notion of computability is obtained. For example, in the powerset of the natural numbers with its standard effective presentation, an element is Scott computable iff it is a recursively enumerable set, and it is Lawson computable iff it is a recursive set. Among other examples, we consider the upper powerdomain of Euclidean space, for which we prove that Scott and Lawson computability coincide with two notions of computability for compact sets recently proposed by Brattka and Weihrauch in the framework of type-two recursion theory.},

We also propose a scheme for choosing the best model from a set of considered models and a test for assessing the validity of the selected model. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method on simulated and S\&P 500 data.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce domain theory in dynamical systems, iterated function systems (fractals) and measure theory. For a discrete dynamical system given by the action of a continuous map $f: X \rightarrow X$ on a metric space $X$, we study the extended dynamical systems $(VX, Vf), (UX, Uf)$ and $(LX, Lf)$ where $V$, $U$ and $L$ are respectively the Vietoris hyperspace, the upper hyperspace and the lower hyperspace functors. We show that if $(X, f)$ is chaotic, then so is $(UX, Uf)$. When $X$ is locally compact, $UX$ is a continuous bounded complete dcpo. If $X$ is second countable as well, then $UX$ will be $\omega$-continuous and can be given an effective structure. We show how strange attractors, attractors of iterated function systems (fractals) and Julia sets are obtained effectively as fixed points of deterministic functions on $UX$ or fixed points of non-deterministic functions on $CUX$ where $C$ is the convex (Plotkin) power domain. We also show that the set $M(X)$ of finite Borel measures on $X$ can be embedded in $PUX$, where $P$ is the probabilistic power domain. This provides an effective framework for measure theory. We then prove that the invariant measure of an hyperbolic iterated function system with probabilities can be obtained as the unique fixed point of an associated continuous function on $PUX$.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a domain-theoretic framework for measure theory and integration of bounded real-valued functions with respect to bounded Borel measures on compact metric spaces. The set of normalised Borel measures of the metric space can be embedded into the maximal elements of the normalised probabilistic power domain of its upper space. Any bounded Borel measure on the compact metric space can then be obtained as the least upper bound of an $\omega$-chain of linear combinations of point valuations (simple valuations) of the upper space, thus providing a constructive setup for these measures. We use this setting to define a new notion of integral of a bounded real-valued function with respect to a bounded Borel measure of a compact metric space. By using an $\omega$-chain of simple valuations, whose lub is the guven Borel measure, we can then obtain increasingly better approximations to the value of the integral, similar to the way the Riemann integral is obtained in calculus by using step functions. We show that all the basic results in the theory of Riemann integration can be extended to this more general setting. Furthermore, with this new notion of integration, the value of the integral, when it exists, coincides with the Lebesgue integral of the function. An immediate area for application is in the theory of iterated function systems with probabilities on compact metric spaces, where we obtain a simple approximating sequence for the integral of a real-valued continuous function with respect to the invariant measure.},

In each case, we show that the distribution of the stochastic process is canonically obtained as the least upper bound of an increasing chain of simple valuations in a probabilistic power domain associated to the process. This leads to various formulas and algorithms to compute the expected values of functions which are continuous almost everywhere with respect to the distribution of the stochastic process. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the invariant distribution of a vector recurrent iterated function system which is used in fractal image compression. We also present a finite algorithm to decode the image.},

It is shown how these models have a logical and effective presentation and how they are used to give a computational framework in several areas in mathematics and physics. These include fractal geometry, where new results on existence and uniqueness of attractors and invariant distributions have been obtained, measure and integration theory, where a generalization of the Riemann theory of integration has been developed, and real arithmetic, where a feasible setting for exact computer arithmetic has been formulated. We give a number of algorithms for computation in the theory of iterated function systems with applications in statistical physics and in period doubling route to chaos; we also show how efficient algorithms have been obtained for computing elementary functions in exact real arithmetic.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, there has been a considerable amount of work on using continuous domains in real analysis. Most notably are the the development of the generalized Riemann integral with applications in fractal geometry, several extensions of the programming language PCF with a real number data type, and a framework and an implementation of a package for exact real number arithmetic.
Based on recursion theory we present here a precise and direct formulation of effective representation of real numbers by continuous domains, which is equivalent to the representation of real numbers by algebraic domains as in the work of Stoltenberg-Hansen and Tucker.
We use basic ingredients of an effective theory of continuous domains to spell out notions of computability for the reals and for functions on the real line. We prove directly that our approach is equivalent to the established Turing-machine based approach which dates back to Grzegorczyk and Lacombe, is used by Pour-El and Richards in their foundational work on computable analysis, and, moreover, is the standard notion of computability among physicists as in the work of Penrose. Our framework makes it possible to capture partial functions in an elegant way and it extends to the complex numbers and the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.},

This property holds for various full subcategories, including that of families of Markov processes on locally compact second countable spaces, and in the larger category where the objects are families of Markov processes on analytic spaces and morphisms are transition probability preserving surjective Borel maps. It also follows that the category of probability measures on Polish spaces and measure-preserving continuous surjective maps has semi-pullbacks. A main consequence of our result is that probabilistic bisimulation for labelled Markov processes on all these categories, defined in terms of spans of morphisms, is an equivalence relation.},

For an effectively given locally compact second countable Hausdorff space and an effectively given locally finite Borel measure on the space, we define the notion of a computable measurable set with respect to the given measure, which is stronger than Sanin's recursive measurable set. The set of computable measurable subsets is closed under complementation, finite unions and finite intersections. We then introduce interval-valued measurable functions and develop the notion of computable measurable functions using interval-valued simple functions. This leads us to the interval versions of the main results of the theory of Lebesgue integration which provide a computable framework for measure and integration theory. The Lebesgue integral of a computable integrable function with respect to an effectively given (\sigma-)finite Borel measure on an effectively given (locally) compact second countable Hausdorff space can be computed up to any required accuracy. We show that, with respect to the metric induced from the L^1 norm, the set of Scott continuous interval-valued functions is dense in the set of interval-valued integrable functions.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we describe and study the concept of an $f$-space, which is then used to determine a class $\mathbb{C}$ of partial (continuous) functionals of all finite types over an arbitrary complete $f$-space (in particular, over the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$). This class of functionals has a high degree of universality which makes it possible to compare various classes of functionals with each other (to determine the ``natural'' action of one class of functionals on another).
The class of functionals $\mathbb{C}$ is the greatest class on which the computable functionals of the class $\{\mathbb{F}_G \st G \in T\}$ naturally act. The class $\{\mathbb{F}_G \st G \in T\}$ is compared with the Kleene-Kreisel functionals.
The theory of computable partial functionals constructed here is a very natural extension of the familiar earlier theory of computable functionals of type [(010)10], although not so much from the point of view of the analysis of the concept of computability, but rather from the mathematical functional point of view. It is also important to note that this theory realizes the idea of constructing computable functionals of higher types starting from just the class of generally recursive functions.
It appears that this theory has some conceptual proximity with Scott's program for constructing a general mathematical program of computation. Unfortunately, we have only comparatively recently become acquainted with this paper and a later paper on the same theme, which has prevented explicit expression of the point of contact and the distance between these theories. It is only worth noting that it is the constructive (computational) aspect of Scott's theory which is least effectively realized in the subsequent publications. In his last article these connections are established more explicitly.
It should also be noted that some of the results in Sec.~7 on the solvability of the problem $P$ have been obtained (in other terms) independently by Chernov who also studied certain topological and constructive properties of the space $\{\Prob_G \st G \in T\}$, which are not studied in this paper.},

  Volume                   = {87},

  Abstract                 = {Synthetic topology as conceived in this monograph has three fundamental aspects:
\begin{enumerate} \item to explain what has been done in classical topology in conceptual terms, \item to provide one-line, enlightening proofs of the theorems that constitute the core of the theory, and \item to smoothly export topological concepts and theorems to unintended situations, keeping the synthetic proofs unmodified. \end{enumerate}
The unintended situation that we focus on is the theory of computation, in particular regarding programming languages from both operational (Part I) and denotational (Part III) points of view, with emphasis on sequential computation. We are aware of other applications of synthetic topology, e.g. to locales, convergence spaces, sequential spaces, equilogical spaces, and some sheaf and realizability toposes, but this will be reported elsewhere.
Aspects 1 and 2 are the subject of Part II. However, it turns out that it is possible to tackle aspect 3 without previous reference to 1 or 2. In fact, we start by developing synthetic topology of programming-language data types in Part I, without assuming any background in classical topology and without introducing any. Part III combines ideas from Parts I and II, developing non-trivial computational applications. The main new result is a computational version of the Tychonoff theorem. We also review previously known applications and explain how topology and semantics interact in program-correctness proofs.
Although computers are finite, infinity shows up in a number of important situations in the theory of computation, e.g. infinity in syntax: loops, recursion; infinity in time: non-terminating computations; infinity of data: stream computation and higher-type computation; infinity in precision: real-number computation; infinity through abstraction: probabilistic descriptions.
The first few chapters of Part I explore how the fundamental topological notions of continuous map, open set, closed set, compact set, Hausdorff space, and discrete space reconcile the finite character of computers with the infinite nature of the entities one wishes to calculate with. One of the main contributions of this monograph is to explain the computational nature of the the notion of compactness. Roughly speaking, a set is compact if and only if, given any semidecidable property, one can semidecide whether it holds for all elements of the set in finite time. Surprisingly, there are infinite computationally compact sets, for example that of infinite streams of binary digits.},

  Abstract                 = {There are two kinds of uncertainty. One kind arises as variability resulting from heterogeneity or stochasticity. The other arises as partial ignorance resulting from systematic measurement error or subjective (epistemic) uncertainty. As most researchers recognize, variability and ignorance should be treated separately in risk analyses. Although a second-order Monte Carlo simulation is commonly employed for this task, this approach often requires unjustified assumptions which may be inappropriate in some circumstances. We argue that the two kinds of uncertainty should be propagated through mathematical expressions with different calculation methods. Basically, interval analysis should be used to propagate ignorance, and probability theory should be used to propagate variability. We demonstrate how using an inappropriate method can yield erroneous results. We also show how ignorance and variability can be represented simultaneously and manipulated in a coherent analysis that does not confound the two forms of uncertainty and distinguishes what is known from what is assumed.},

  Abstract                 = {Continuous valuations have been proposed by several authors as a way of modelling probabilistic non-determinism in programming language semantics. Let $(X, {\cal O})$ be a topological space. A quasi-simple valuation on $X$ is the sup of a directed family of simple valuations. We show that quasi-simple valuations are exactly those valuations that extend to continuous valuations to the Alexandroff topology on the specialisation preordering of the topology $\cal O$. A number of applications are presented. In particular, we recover Jones' result that every continuous valuation is quasi-simple if $X$ is a continuous dcpo – in this case there is a least extension to the Alexandroff topology. We show that this can be refined if $X$ is algebraic, where every continuous valuation is the sup of a directed family of simple valuations based on finite elements. We exhibit another class of spaces in which every continuous valuation is quasi-simple, the so-called finitarily coherent spaces – in this case there is a largest extension to the Alexandroff topology. In general, the extension to the Alexandroff topology is not unique, unless, for example, the original valuation is bicontinuous. We also show that other natural spaces of valuations, namely those of discrete valuations and point-continuous valuations, can be characterised by similar extension theorems.},

It then provides a systematic introduction to probability theory, and in particular, those parts that are used in statistics. The Volume discusses the law of large numbers for independent and non-independent random variables, transforms, special distributions, convergence in law, the central limit theorem for normal and infinitely divisible laws, conditional expectations and martingales. Unusual topics include the uniqueness and convergence theorem for general transforms with characteristic functions, Laplace transforms, moment transforms and generating functions as special examples. The text contains substantive applications, e.g., epidemic models, the ballot problem, stock market models and water reservoir models, and a discussion of the historical background. The exercise sets contain a variety of problems ranging from simple exercises to extensions of the theory.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we generalize the construction of a domain-theoretic integral, introduced by Professor~Abbas~Edalat, in locally compact separable Hausdorff spaces, to general Hausdorff spaces embedded in a domain. Our main example of such spaces comprises general metric spaces embedded in the rounded ideal completion of the partially ordered set of formal balls. We go on to discuss analytic subsets of a general Hausdorff space, and give a sufficient condition for a measure supported on an analytic set to be approximated by a sequence of simple valuations. In particular, this condition is always satisfied in a metric space embedded in the rounded ideal completion of its formal ball space. We finish with a comments section, where we highlight some potential areas for future research and discuss some questions of computability.},

  Abstract                 = {We give a probabilistic powerdomain construction on the category of inductively complete partial orders; it is the partial order of continuous $[0, 1]$-valued evaluations on the Scott topology. By means of a theory of integration with respect to such evaluations, the powerdomain is shown to be a monad, and indeed one gets a model for Moggi's computational lambda-calculus. One can also solve recursive domain equations involving the powerdomain, and all this gives a meta-language for programming languages with probabilistic features. This is used to give the semantics of a language with a probabilistic parallel construct. We show the construction generalises previous work on partial orders of measures, and indeed restricts to the category of continuous partial orders, where it can be characterised as a free continuous finitary algebra.},

  Abstract                 = {Much of theoretical computer science is based on use of inductive complete partially ordered sets (or ipos). The aim of this thesis is to extend this successful theory to make it applicable to probabilistic computations. The method is to construct a ``probabilistic powerdomain'' on any ipo to represent the outcome of a probabilistic program which has outputs in the original ipo. In this thesis it is shown that evaluations (functions which assign a probability to open sets with various conditions) form such a powerdomain. Further, the powerdomain is a monadic functor on the category \textbf{Ipo}.
For restricted classes of ipos a powerdomain of probability distributions, or measures which only take values less than one, has been constructed (by Saheb-Djahromi). In this thesis we show that this powerdomain may be constructed for continuous ipos where it is isomorphic to that of evaluations.
The powerdomain of evaluations is shown to have a simple Stone type duality between it and sets of upper continuous functions. This is then used to give a Hoare style logic for an imperative probabilistic language, which is the dual of the probabilistic semantics.
Finally, the powerdomain is used to give a denotational semantics of a probabilistic metalanguage which is an extension of Moggi's $\lambda_c$-calculus for the powerdomain monad. The semantics is then shown to be equivalent to an operational semantics.},

It is written for readers familiar with measure-theoretic probability and discrete-time processes, who wish to explore stochastic processes in continuous time. The vehicle chosen for this exposition is Brownian motion, which is presented as the canonical example of both a martingale and a Markov process with continuous paths. In this context, the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic calculus is developed. The power of this calculus is illustrated by results concerning representations of martingales and change of measure on Wiener space, and these in turn permit a presentation of recent advances in financial economics (option pricing and consumption/investment optimization).
The book contains a detailed discussion of weak and strong solutions of stochastic differential equations and a study of local time for semimartingales, with special emphasis on the theory of Brownian local time. The text is complemented by a large number of problems and exercises.},

  Abstract                 = {Massive datasets, made available today by modern technologies, present a significant challenge to scientists who need to effectively and efficiently extract relevant knowledge and information.
Due to their ability to model uncertainty, interval and soft computing techniques have been found to be effective in this extraction. This book provides coverage of the basic theoretical foundations for applying these techniques to artificial intelligence and knowledge processing.
The first three chapters provide the background needed for those who are unfamiliar with interval and soft computing techniques. The following chapters describe innovative algorithms and their applications to knowledge processing.
In particular, these chapters cover computing techniques for interval linear systems of equations, interval matrix singular-value decomposition, interval function approximation, and decision making with statistical and graph-based data processing. To enable these applications, the book presents a standards-based object-oriented interval computing environment in C++.
By providing the necessary background and summarizing recent results and successful applications, this self-contained book will serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners wanting to learn interval and soft computing techniques and apply them to artificial intelligence and knowledge processing.},

  Abstract                 = {It is the purpose of this monograph to develop probability theory from a postulational standpoint. For this purpose a probability field is defined as an assemblage with a definite ordering of numbers that satisfy the system of axioms. A brief exposition is given of the construction of such fields and of the manner in which the framework of the postulational system can be related to the applications to phenomena. The addition and multiplication theorems follow at once. Moreover, the theorem of Bayes, concerning whose validity there have been many controversies, is also an almost immediate consequence of the system of postulates, but the reviewer does not think this derivation of the theorem of Bayes settles the old contention relative to the validity of inferring the characteristics of a statistical population from a sample by means of the theorem of Bayes.
Use is made of the Lebesgue theories of measure and of integration. Indeed, it is held that it seemed almost hopeless to deal with the logical foundations of probability without these theories.
The development includes infinite probability fields by means of an additional axiom, distribution functions in space of many dimensions, differentiation and integration of mathematical expectations, and the law of large numbers. This little book seems to the reviewer to be an important contribution directed towards securing a more logical development of probability theory.},

  Abstract                 = {This volume in Richard Silverman's exceptional series of translations of Russian works in the mathematical sciences is a comprehensive, elementary introduction to real and functional analysis by two faculty members from Moscow University. It is self-contained, evenly paced, eminently readable, and readily accessible to those with adequate preparation in advanced calculus.
The first four chapters present basic concepts and introductory principles in set theory, metric spaces, topological spaces, and linear spaces. The next two chapters consider linear functionals and linear operators, with detailed discussions of continuous linear functionals, the conjugate space, the weak topology and weak convergence, generalized functions, basic concepts of linear operators, inverse and adjoint operators, and completely continuous operators. The final four chapters cover measure, integration, differentiation, and more on integration. Special attention is here given to the Lebesgue integral, Fubini's theorem, and the Stieltjes integral. Each individual section --- there are 37 in all --- is equipped with a problem set, making a total of some 350 problems, all carefully selected and matched.
With these problems and the clear exposition, this book is useful for self-study or for the classroom --- it is a basic one-year course in real analysis. Dr.~Silverman is a former member of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University and the Lincoln Library of M.I.T. Along with his translation, he has revised the text with numerous pedagogical and mathematical improvements and restyled the language so that it is even more readable.},

A standard theory of effectivity on $\mathbb{F} = \{f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\}$ has been developed in a previous paper. By representations $\delta: \mathbb{F} \rightarrow M$ this theory is extended to other sets $M$. Topological and recursion theoretical properties of representations are studied, where the final topology of a representation plays an essential role. It is shown that for any separable $T_0$-space an (up to equivalence) unique admissible representation can be defined which reflects the topological properties correctly.},

  Abstract                 = {What better guide could we have to the 2008 financial crisis and its resolution than the newest Nobel Laureate in Economics, columnist and author Paul Krugman?
In a dazzling and prescient polemic, now fully updated from his 1999 classic, Krugman shows how today's situation parallels the events that caused the Great Depression. He surveys the economic crises that swept across Asia, Russia and Latin America in the 1990s, and reveals that those crises were a warning for all of us. Now depression economics has returned: when the great housing bubble of the mid-2000s burst, the Western financial system proved as vulnerable as those of developing countries caught up in earlier crises --- and a replay of the 1930s seems all too plausible.
Krugman shows how it happened and lays out the steps that must be taken to turn around a world economy sliding into a deep recession. Brilliantly crafted in his trademark style --- lucid, lively, and supremely informed --- this will become a cornerstone of the debate over how to respond to our current economic predicament.},

  Abstract                 = {\emph{Elements of Operator Theory} is aimed at graduate students as well as a new generation of mathematicians and scientists who need to apply operator theory to their field. Written in a user-friendly, motivating style, fundamental topics are presented in a systematic fashion, i.e., set theory, algebraic structures, topological structures, Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces, culminating with the Spectral Theorem, one of the landmarks in the theory of operators on Hilbert spaces. The exposition is concept-driven and as much as possible avoids the formula-computational approach.
Key features of this largely self-contained work include:
\begin{itemize} \item required background material to each chapter \item fully rigorous proofs, over 300 of them, are specially tailored to the presentation and some are new \item more than 100 examples and, in several cases, interesting counterexamples that demonstrate the frontiers of an important theorem \item over 300 problems, many with hints \item both problems and examples underscore further auxiliary results and extensions of the main theory; in this non-traditional framework, the reader is challenged and has a chance to prove the pricnipal theorems anew \end{itemize}
This work is an excellent text for the classroom as well as a self-study resource for researchers. Prerequisites include an introduction to analysis and to functions of a complex variable, which most first-year graduate students in mathematics, engineering, or another formal science have already acquired. Measure theory and integration theory are required only for the last section of the final chapter.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides a general valuation method for the European options whose payoff is restricted by curved boundaries contractually set on the underlying asset price process when it follows the geometric Brownian motion. Our result is based on the generalization of the Levy formula on the Brownian motion by T. W. Anderson in sequential analysis. We give the explicit probability formula that the geometric Brownian motion reaches in an interval at the maturity date without hitting either the lower or the upper curved boundaries. Although the general pricing formulae for options with boundaries are expressed as infinite series in the general case, our numerical study suggests that the convergence of the series is rapid. Our results include the formulae for options with a lower boundary by Merton (1973), for path-dependent options by Goldman, Sossin, and Gatto (1979), and for some corporate securities as special cases.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of experimental data resulting from some underlying random process is a fundamental part of most scientific research. Probability Theory and Statistics have been developed as flexible tools for this analysis, and have been applied successfully in various fields such as Biology, Economics, Engineering, Medicine or Psychology. However, traditional techniques in Probability and Statistics were devised to model only a single source of uncertainty, namely randomness. In many real-life problems randomness arises in conjunction with other sources, making the development of additional ``softening'' approaches essential. This book is a collection of papers presented at the 2nd International Conference on Soft Methods in Probability and Statistics (SMPS'2004) held in Oviedo, providing a comprehensive overview of the innovative new research taking place within this emerging field.},

  Abstract                 = {Sampling from probability density functions (pdfs) has become more and more important in many areas of applied science, and has therefore been the subject of great attention. Many sampling procedures proposed allow for approximate or asymptotic sampling. On the other hand, very few methods allow for exact sampling. Direct sampling of standard pdfs is feasible, but sampling of much more complicated pdfs is often required. Rejection sampling allows to exactly sample from univatiate pdfs, but has the hige drawback of needing a case-by-case calculation of a comparison function that often reveals as a tremendous chore, whose results dramatically affect the efficiency of the sampling procedure. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to a pdf that is proportional to a product of standard distributions. From there, we show that an automated selection of both the comparison function and the upper bound is possible. Moreover, this choice is performed in order to optimize the sampling efficiency among a range of potential solutions. Finally, the method is illustrated on a few examples.},

In particular, $\ker\mu$ must be metrisable in its relative Scott topology. Moreover, the space $\ker\skew3\bar{\mu}$ in its relative Scott topology is homeomorphic to the Vietoris hyperspace of $\ker\mu$, that is, the space of non-empty compact subsets of $\ker\mu$ in its Vietoris topology – the topology induced by any Hausdorff metric. This enables one to show that Hutchinson's theorem holds for any finite set of contractions on a domain with a Lebesgue measurement. Finally, after resolving the existence question for Lebesgue measurements on countably based domains, we uncover the following relationship between classical analysis and domain theory: for an $\omega$-continuous dcpo $D$ with $\max(D)$ regular, the Vietoris hyperspace of $\max(D)$ embeds in $\max({\mathbf C} D)$ as the kernel of a measurement on ${\mathbf C} D$.},

  Abstract                 = {Highly regarded among mathematicians for its exceptional clarity, imaginative and instructive exercises, and fine writing style, this concise book offers an ideal introduction to the fundamentals of topology. Originally conceived as a text for a one-semester course, it is directed to undergraduate students whose studies of calculus sequence have included definitions and proofs of theorems. The book's principal aim is to provide a simple, thorough survey of elementary topics in the study of collections of objects, or sets, that possess a mathematical structure.
The author begins with an informal discussion of set theory in Chapter~1, reserving coverage of the concept of countability for Chapter~5, where it appears in the context of compactness. In the second chapter Professor~Mendelson discusses metric spaces, paying particular attention to various distance functions which may be defined on Euclidean $n$-space and which lead to the ordinary topology.
Chapter~3 takes up the concept of topological space, presenting it as a generalization of the concept of a metric space. Chapters~4 and 5 are devoted to a discussion of the two most important topological properties: connectedness and compactness. Throughout the text, Dr.~Mendelson, a former Professor of Mathematics at Smith College, has included many challenging and stimulating exercises to help students develop a solid grasp of the material presented.},

We present basic facts about weak and weak star topologies, dual spaces and representations of linear functionals as Radon measures. A special attention is payed to finitely additive measures and some results regarding the Baire sets. We prove that in a wide class of topological spaces (e.g. in non-compact metric spaces), the set of probability measures is not closed under weak star convergence, and we discuss measures in the closure. A classical theory of weak convergence of probability measures, including Prohorov's theorem is also presented. The second part of the paper is devoted to probability measures on separable Hilbert spaces. We discuss characteristic functions and its properties. The topic of weak compactness is studied assuming that a Hilbert space is equipped with the weak topology and with the norm topology separately. Here we also present a Prohorov's theorem on Hilbert spaces with the weak topology.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic geometry is a relatively new branch of mathematics. Although its predecessors such as geometric probability date back to the 18th century, the formal concept of a random set was developed in the beginning of the 1970s. \emph{Theory of Random Sets} presents a state-of-the-art treatment of the modern theory, but it does not neglect to recall and build on the foundations laid by Matheron and others, including the vast advances in stochastic geometry, probability theory, set-valued analysis, and statistical inference of the 1990s.
The book is entirely self-contained, systematic and exhaustive, with the full proofs that are necessary to gain insight. It shows the various interdisciplinary relationships of random set theory within other parts of mathematics, and at the same time, fixes terminology and notation that are often varying in the current literature to establish it as a natural part of modern probability theory, and to provide a platform for future development. An extensive, searchable bibliography to accompany the book is freely available via the Web.
This book will be an inbaluable reference for probabilists, mathematicians in convex and integral geometry, set-valued analysis, capacity and potential theory, mathematical statisticians in spatial statistics and image analysis, specialists in mathematical economics, and electronic and electrical engineers interested in image analysis.

Mutual relationships between the computability notion of a probability distribution and that of the corresponding distribution function are discussed.

We then define the effective convergence of probability distributions as an effectivization of the classical vague convergence. For distribution functions, computability and effective convergence are naturally defined as real functions. A weaker effective convergence is also defined as an effectivization of pointwise convergence.},

  abstract =  {This is a postgraduate level textbook, written specifically for use at universities in India and fills a long-felt need. It has several welcome features. Motivation and heuristic explanations are provided before introducing many of the concepts; bases and subbases of a topology are given more attention than most books do; both filters and nets are treated in great details, and there is also a discussion on the so-called equivalence of the two concepts; gives a detailed treatment of image and quotient topologies. Compactification is treated in far greater detail than any other book, with ample warnings about common pitfalls. The presentation of compactifications is rigorous and yet easier to understand. The chapter on Uniform Spaces proceeds at a pace that the student will find easier to handle. A large number and a broad spectrum of exercises are given at the end of each chapter. The introductory chapter has a list of over a hundred set-theoretic identities which the student should find very handy as a reference list. There is an extensive bibliography for the library-oriented student. An excellent index of keywords and another of notations make the job of searching and cross-referencing easy. The first edition and the subsequent revised edition of this book have been remarkably well received.},

  Abstract                 = {Clouds are a concept for uncertainty mediating between the concept of a fuzzy set and that of a probability distribution. A cloud is to a random variable more or less what an interval is to a number. We discuss the basic theoretical and numerical properties of clouds, and relate them to histograms, cumulative distribution functions, and likelihood ratios.
We show how to compute nonlinear transformations of clouds, using global optimization and contraint satisfaction techniques. We also show how to compute rigorous enclosures for the expectation of arbitrary functions of random variables, and for probabilities of arbitrary statements involving random variables, even for problems involving more than a few variables.
Finally, we relate clouds to concepts from fuzzy set theory, in particular to the consistent possibility and necessity measures of Jamison and Lodwick.},

  Abstract                 = {In this approach to the semantics of nondeterminism, we introduce and study the complete partial order (cpo) of probability distributions on a domain. The approach avoids considering equivalent subsets, used in theory of powerdomains, which may lead to some unwelcome identifications. These results show that the class of probability distributions on a cpo is itself a cpo and that every probability distribution is the lub of an increasing sequence of ‘finite’ probability distributions. We introduce the probabilistic extensions of continuous functions in order to extend the ‘usual’ continuous functions on this new domain. On the other hand the structure of this cpo suggests introducing an operation called ‘random selection’, which is the counterpart of the ‘OR’ (or union) operation, commonly used in nondeterministic programs. The paper then studies the ‘naturalness’ of these extended notions and treats the question of continuity, which is of prime importance in the Scott theory of fixed point semantics.},

Given such a representation, we show that probabilistic processes on infinite words, under which each successive symbol is determined by a finite probabilistic choice, generate Borel probability measures on the represented space. Conversely, for several well-behaved types of space, every Borel probability measure is represented by a corresponding probabilistic process. Accordingly, we consider probabilistic processes as providing “probabilistic names” for Borel probability measures. We show that integration is computable with respect to the induced representation of measures.},

Such concepts as ``specifications'', ``predicate transformerr'', and ``nondeterminism'' can be greatly illuminated by being formulated in topological terms. The specific tasks we undertake are: to provide a more adequate framework for power-domain constructions; and to show that the connection between (Dijkstra's) weakest preconditions and the Smyth powerdomain, established by Plotkin for the case of flat domains, actually holds in full generality.},

  Author                   = {Doron Swade and Charles Babbage},

  Year                     = {2001},

  Abstract                 = {In 1821 an inventor and mathematician, Charles Babbage, was poring over a set of mathematical tables. Finding error after error Babbage exclaimed, "I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam." His frustration was not simply at the grindingly tedious labor of checking manually evaluated tables, but at their daunting unreliability. Science, engineering, construction, banking, and insurance depended on tables for calculation. Ships navigating by the stars relied on them to find their positions at sea.
Babbage launched himself on a grand venture to design and build mechanical calculating engines that would eliminate such errors. His bid to build infallible machines is a saga of ingenuity and will, which led beyond mechanized arithmetic into the entirely new realm of computing. Through Ada, Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron, we gain tantalizing insights into how at least one Victorian glimpsed the promise of what was to come. Babbage springs out of history like a jack-in-the-box: a gentleman philosopher, a tireless inventor, a vigorous socialite, and a mesmerizing raconteur. "Mr. Babbage is coming to dinner" was a coup for any hostess.
Drawing on previously unused archival material, The Difference Engine is a tale of both Babbage's nineteenth-century quest to build a calculating engine and its twentieth-century sequel. For in 1991, Babbage's vision was finally realized, at least in part, by the completion at the Science Museum in London of the first full-sized Babbage engine, finished in time for the 200th anniversary of Babbage's birth. The two quests are mutually illuminating and are recounted here by the-then Curator of Computing, Doron Swade -- one of the main protagonists of the successful resumption of Babbage's extraordinary work.},

  Abstract                 = {In this brief study we explicitly match the properties of spaces modelled by domains with the structure of their models. We claim that each property of the modelled topology is coupled with some construct in the model. Examples are pairs (i) first-countability --- strictly monotone map, (ii) developability --- measurement, (iii) metrizability --- partial metric, (iv) ultrametrizability --- tree, (v) Cloquet-completeness --- dcpo, and more. By making this correspondence precise and explicit we reveal \emph{how} domains model topologies.},

  Abstract                 = {While for countable sets there is a single well established computability theory (ordinary recursion theory), Computable Analysis is still underdeveloped. Several mutually non-equivalent theories have been proposed for it, none of which, however, has been accepted by the majority of mathematicians or computer scientists. In this contribution one of these theories, TTE (Type 2 Theorie of Effectivity), is presented, which at least in the author's opinion has important advantages over the others. TTE intends to characterize and study exactly those functions, operators etc. known from Analysis, which can be realized correctly by digital computers. The paper gives a short introduction to basic concepts of TTE and shows its general applicability by some selected examples. First, Turing computability is generalized from finite to infinite sequences of symbols. Assuming that digital computers can handle (w.l.o.g.) only sequences of symbols, infinite sequences of symbols are used as names for “infinite objects” such as real numbers, open sets, compact sets or continuous functions. Naming systems are called representations. Since only very few representations are of interest in applications, a very fundamental principle for defining effective representations for T0-spaces with countable bases is introduced. The concepts are applied to real numbers, open sets, compact sets and continuous functions. The problem of determining zeroes is considered. Computational complexity is discussed and computability in measure theory is sketched. The paper concludes with some remarks on other models for Computable Analysis.},

Are differentiation and integration computable operators? Is zero finding for complex polynomials computable? Is the Mandelbrot set decidable? And in case of computability, what is the computational complexity? Computable analysis supplies exact definitions for these and many other similar questions and tries to solve them.
Merging fundamental concepts of analysis and recursion theory to a new exciting theory, this book provides a solid fundament for studying various aspects of computability and complexity in analysis. It is the result of an introductory course given for several years and is written in a style suitable for graduate-level and senior students in computer science and mathematics. Many examples illustrate new concepts while numerous exercises of varying difficulty extend the material and stimulate readers to work actively on the text.},

He helps students build the intuition needed, in a presentation enriched with examples drawn from all manner of applications, e.g., genetics, filtering, the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula, quantum probability and computing, and classical and modern statistical models. Statistics chapters present both the Frequentist and Bayesian approaches, emphasising Confidence Intervals rather than Hypothesis Test, and include Gibbs-sampling techniques for the practical implementation of Bayesian methods. A central chapter gives the theory of Linear Regression and ANOVA, and explains how MCMC methods allow greater flexibility in modelling.

A Gaussian filter is approximation of the Bayesian inference with the Gaussian posterior probability density assumption being valid. There exists a variation of Gaussian filters in the literature that derived themselves from very different backgrounds. From the numerical-integration viewpoint, various versions of Gaussian filters are only distinctive from each other in their specific treatments of approximating the multiple statistical integrations. A common base is provided for the first time to analyze and compare Gaussian filters with respect to accuracy, efficiency and stability factor. This study is expected to facilitate the selection of appropriate Gaussian filters in practice and to help design more efficient filters by employing better numerical integration methods.},

Especially notable in this course is the clearly expressed orientation toward the natural sciences and its informal exploration of the essence and the roots of the basic concepts and theorems of calculus. Clarity of exposition is matched by a wealth of instructive exercises, problems and fresh applications to areas seldom touched on in real analysis books. The second volume expounds classical analysis as it is today, as a part of unified mathematics, and its interactions with modern mathematical courses such as algebra, differential geometry, differential equations, complex and functional analysis. The book provides a firm foundation for advanced work in any of these directions.},

  abstract  = {Last three decades, artificial intelligence have become mandatory for human lives since the revolution of computers. As a part of it, Machine Learning and the proposed techniques are used to solve the real life problems instead of humans by using their extended capabilities for classification, optimization, and as well as prediction. However, there is a big mystery for the optimum technique for any kind of data and problem domain. In this paper, preliminary experiments are performed using recent and challenging nine datasets and four popular machine learning techniques in order to determine optimum technique for prediction domain. Obtained results are analyzed using three evaluation methods; MSE value, EV and R2 scores. Obtained results showed that, increment or degradation of instances in datasets do not affect the performance of the techniques directly and neural network algorithms produce higher and more steady prediction rates.},

  abstract = {In behavioural ecology, stochastic dynamic programming may be used as a general method for calculating animals' optimal behavioural policies. But how might the animals themselves learn optimal policies from their experience? The aim of the thesis is to give a systematic analysis of possible computational methods of learning efficient behaviour.

First, it is argued that it does follow from the optimality assumption that animals should learn optimal policies, even though they may not always follow them. Next, it is argued that Markov decision processes are a general formal model of an animal's behavioural choices in its environment. The conventional methods of determining optimal policies by dynamic programming are then described. It is not plausible that animals carry out calculations of this type.

However, there is a range of alternative methods of organising dynamic programming calculation, in ways that are plausible computational models of animal learning. In particular, there is an incremental Monte-Carlo method that enables the optimal values (or `canonical costs') of actions to be learned directly, without any requirement for the animal to model its environment, or to remember situations and actions for more than a short period of time. A proof is given that this learning method works. Learning methods of this type are also possible for hierarchical policies. Previously suggested learning methods are reviewed, and some even simpler learning methods are presented without proof. Demonstration implementations of some of the learning methods are described.},

  abstract = {{SARS-CoV-2} has caused tens of thousands of infections and more than one thousand deaths. There are currently no registered therapies for treating coronovirus infections. Because of time consuming process of new drug development, drug repositioning may be the only solution to the epidemic of sudden infectious diseases. We systematically analyzed all the proteins encoded by {SARS-CoV-2} genes, compared them with proteins from other coronaviruses, predicted their structures, and built 19 structures that could be done by homology modeling. By performing target-based virtual ligand screening, a total of 21 targets (including two human targets) were screened against compound libraries including {ZINC} drug database and our own database of natural products. Structure and screening results of important targets such as 3-chymotrypsin-like protease ({3CLpro}), {Spike}, {RNA}-dependent {RNA} polymerase ({RdRp}), and papain like protease ({PLpro}) were discussed in detail. In addition, a database of 78 commonly used antiviral drugs including those currently on the market and undergoing clinical trials for {SARS-CoV-2} was constructed. Possible targets of these compounds and potential drugs acting on a certain target were predicted. This study will provide new lead compounds and targets for further \textit{in vitro} and \textit{in vivo} studies of {SARS-CoV-2}, new insights for those drugs currently ongoing clinical studies, and also possible new strategies for drug repositioning to treat {SARS-CoV-2} infections.},

  abstract = {The novel coronavirus {SARS-CoV-2}, the causative agent of {COVID-19} respiratory disease, has infected over 2.3 million people, killed over 160,000, and caused worldwide social and economic disruption. There are currently no antiviral drugs with proven clinical efficacy, nor are there vaccines for its prevention, and these efforts are hampered by limited knowledge of the molecular details of {SARS-CoV-2} infection. To address this, we cloned, tagged and expressed 26 of the 29 SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells and identified the human proteins physically associated with each using affinity-purification mass spectrometry ({AP-MS}), identifying 332 high-confidence {SARS-CoV-2}-human protein-protein interactions ({PPIs}). Among these, we identify 66 druggable human proteins or host factors targeted by 69 compounds (29 {FDA}-approved drugs, 12 drugs in clinical trials, and 28 preclinical compounds). Screening a subset of these in multiple viral assays identified two sets of pharmacological agents that displayed antiviral activity: inhibitors of {mRNA} translation and predicted regulators of the {Sigma1} and {Sigma2} receptors. Further studies of these host factor targeting agents, including their combination with drugs that directly target viral enzymes, could lead to a therapeutic regimen to treat {COVID-19}.},

  abstract = {Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID-19}) is caused by {SARS}-coronavirus 2 ({SARS-CoV-2}). Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 ({ACE2}) and transmembrane protease serine 2 ({TMPRSS2}) mediate viral infection of host cells. We reasoned that differences in {ACE2} or {TMPRSS2} gene expression in sputum cells among asthma patients may identify subgroups at risk for {COVID19} morbidity. Methods: We analyzed gene expression for {ACE2} and {TMPRSS2}, and for intercellular adhesion molecule 1 ({ICAM-1}) (rhinovirus receptor as a comparator), in sputum cells from 330 participants in the Severe Asthma Research Program-3 and 79 healthy controls. Results: Gene expression of {ACE2} was lower than {TMPRSS2}, and expression levels of both genes was similar in asthma and health. Among asthma patients, male gender, African Americans race, and history of diabetes mellitus, was associated with higher expression of {ACE2} and {TMPRSS2}. Use of inhaled corticosteroids ({ICS}) was associated with lower expression of {ACE2} and {TMPRSS2}, but treatment with triamcinolone acetonide ({TA}) did not decrease expression of either gene. These findings differed from those for {ICAM-1}, where gene expression was increased in asthma and less consistent differences were observed related to gender, race, and use of ICS. Conclusion: Higher expression of {ACE2} and {TMPRSS2} in males, African Americans, and patients with diabetes mellitus provides rationale for monitoring these asthma subgroups for poor {COVID19} outcomes. The lower expression of {ACE2} and {TMPRSS2} with {ICS} use warrants prospective study of {ICS} use as a predictor of decreased susceptibility to {SARS-CoV-2} infection and decreased {COVID19} morbidity.},

  abstract = {A novel coronavirus was recently discovered and termed {SARS-CoV-2}. Human infection can cause coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID-19}), which has been rapidly spreading around the globe. {SARS-CoV-2} shows some similarities to other coronaviruses. However, treatment options and a cellular understanding of {SARS-CoV-2} infection are lacking. Here we identify the host cell pathways modulated by {SARS-CoV-2} infection and show that inhibition of these pathways prevent viral replication in human cells. We established a human cell culture model for infection with {SARS-CoV-2} clinical isolate. Employing this system, we determined the {SARS-CoV-2} infection profile by translatome and proteome proteomics at different times after infection. These analyses revealed that {SARS-CoV-2} reshapes central cellular pathways, such as translation, splicing, carbon metabolism and nucleic acid metabolism. Small molecule inhibitors targeting these pathways prevented viral replication in cells. Our results reveal the cellular infection profile of {SARS-CoV-2} and led to the identification of drugs inhibiting viral replication. We anticipate our results to guide efforts to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying host cell modulation upon {SARS-CoV-2} infection. Furthermore, our findings provide insight for the development of therapy options for {COVID-19}.},

  abstract  = {Fibrotic diseases, such as liver, pulmonary and renal fibrosis, are common end-stage conditions and represent a major global health problem. Furthermore, effective therapeutic measures are presently unavailable. Extracellular matrix accumulation is the most prominent characteristic in the pathogenesis of fibrotic disease. Retinoic acid, including all-trans retinoic acid, 9-cis and 13-cis retinoic acid, play important roles in various physiological processes, such as in embryonic development, reproduction, vision, cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and inflammation. Present studies report that retinoic acid treatment may affect various processes involved in the onset and progression of fibrotic disease. However, the therapeutic effects of retinoic acid in such diseases remain controversial. Several reports indicate that retinoic acid positively affects the progression of fibrosis and alleviates the accumulation of the extracellular matrix, whereas other studies report the opposite; that retinoic acid exacerbates fibrosis and induces extracellular matrix accumulation. Signaling pathways might be an important influencing factor and differences in signaling events might be responsible for the contradictory role of retinoic acid in fibrotic diseases. Since there was no review available that investigated the role of retinoic acid and the signaling pathways involved, we retrospectively studied the literature and provide a comprehensive analysis of retinoic acid's role in fibrotic diseases, and provide an overview of the signal transduction pathways involved in its pathogenesis.},

  abstract  = {In severe cases of coronavirus disease 2019 ({COVID-19}), viral pneumonia progresses to respiratory failure. Neutrophil extracellular traps ({NETs}) are extracellular webs of chromatin, microbicidal proteins, and oxidant enzymes that are released by neutrophils to contain infections. However, when not properly regulated, {NETs} have potential to propagate inflammation and microvascular thrombosis — including in the lungs of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome. While elevated levels of blood neutrophils predict worse outcomes in {COVID-19}, the role of {NETs} has not been investigated. We now report that sera from patients with {COVID-19} ($n = 50$ patients, $n = 84$ samples) have elevated levels of cell-free {DNA}, myeloperoxidase({MPO})-{DNA}, and citrullinated histone {H3} ({Cit-H3}); the latter two are highly specific markers of {NETs}. Highlighting the potential clinical relevance of these findings, cell-free {DNA} strongly correlated with acute phase reactants including {C}-reactive protein, {D}-dimer, and lactate dehydrogenase, as well as absolute neutrophil count. {MPO-DNA} associated with both cell-free {DNA} and absolute neutrophil count, while {Cit-H3} correlated with platelet levels. Importantly, both cell-free {DNA} and {MPO-DNA} were higher in hospitalized patients receiving mechanical ventilation as compared with hospitalized patients breathing room air. Finally, sera from individuals with {COVID-19} triggered {NET} release from control neutrophils in vitro. In summary, these data reveal high levels of {NETs} in many patients with {COVID-19}, where they may contribute to cytokine release and respiratory failure. Future studies should investigate the predictive power of circulating {NETs} in longitudinal cohorts, and determine the extent to which {NETs} may be novel therapeutic targets in severe {COVID-19}.},

  abstract  = {The cotton rat was evaluated as a model for anti-inflammatory and antiviral influenza therapy. Beginning 3 days after intranasal infection with {10(7)} tissue culture infectious doses-50% ({TCID})(50) of an {H3N2} human influenza, animals were treated topically via intranasal lavage with a range of doses of triamcinolone acetonide (1, 4, or 16 mg/kg), alone or in combination with a neuraminidase inhibitor or anti-influenza convalescent serum. Pulmonary histopathologic changes were dramatically decreased in animals treated with 4 or 16 mg/kg of triamcinolone, with little additional benefit from addition of a neuraminidase inhibitor or topical serum, agents which were much less effective when used alone. A high degree of suppression of {IFN}-gamma levels was observed in all combinations where 4 or 16 mg/kg of triamcinolone were used. Viral replication was not prolonged by corticosteroid therapy. Tissue damage during influenza infection may be greatly reduced by combination antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapy.},

  abstract  = {Acute hypercytokinaemia represents an imbalance of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and is believed to be responsible for the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure in severe cases of avian ({H5N1}) influenza. Although neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in treating avian influenza, especially if given within 48 h of infection, it is harder to prevent the resultant hypercytokinaemia from developing if the patient does not seek timely medical assistance. Steroids have been used for many decades in a wide variety of inflammatory conditions in which hypercytokinaemia plays a role, such as sepsis and viral infections, including severe acquired respiratory syndromes and avian influenza. However, to date, the results have been mixed. Part of the reason for the discrepancies might be the lack of understanding that low doses are required to prevent mortality in cases of adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency, as defined in the sepsis/shock literature, is a plasma cortisol rise of at least 9 microg dl(-1) following a 250 microg dose of adrenocorticotropin hormone ({ACTH}), or reaching a plasma cortisol concentration of >25 microg dl(-1) following a 1-2 microg dose of {ACTH}. In addition, in the case of hypercytokinaemia induced by potent viruses, such as {H5N1}, systemic inflammation-induced, acquired glucocorticoid resistance is likely to be present. Adrenal insufficiency can be overcome, however, with prolonged (7-10 or more days) supraphysiological steroid treatment at a sufficiently high dose to address the excess activation of {NF-kappaB}, but low enough to avoid immune suppression. This is a much lower dose than has been typically used to treat avian influenza patients. Although steroids cannot be used as a monotherapy in the treatment of avian influenza, there might be a potential role for their use as an adjunct treatment to antiviral therapy if appropriate dosages can be determined. In this paper, likely mechanisms of adrenal insufficiency are discussed, drawing from a broad background of literature sources.},

  abstract  = {Influenza A viruses are important pathogens of humans and animals. While seasonal influenza viruses infect humans every year, occasionally animal-origin viruses emerge to cause pandemics with significantly higher morbidity and mortality rates. In March 2013, the public health authorities of China reported three cases of laboratory confirmed human infection with avian influenza A ({H7N9}) virus, and subsequently there have been many cases reported across South East Asia and recently in North America. Most patients experience severe respiratory illness, and morbidity with mortality rates near 40%. No vaccine is currently available and the use of antivirals is complicated due the frequent emergence of drug resistant strains. Thus, there is an imminent need to identify new drug targets for therapeutic intervention. In the current study, a high-throughput screening ({HTS}) assay was performed using microRNA ({miRNA}) inhibitors to identify new host {miRNA} targets that reduce influenza {H7N9} replication in human respiratory ({A549}) cells. Validation studies lead to a top hit, {hsa-miR-664a-3p}, that had potent antiviral effects in reducing {H7N9} replication ({TCID50} titers) by two logs. In silico pathway analysis revealed that this {microRNA} targeted the {LIF} and {NEK7} genes with effects on pro-inflammatory factors. In follow up studies using {siRNAs}, anti-viral properties were shown for LIF. Furthermore, inhibition of {hsa-miR-664a-3p} also reduced virus replication of pandemic influenza A strains {H1N1} and {H3N2}.},

  abstract  = {It has been believed that acute lung injury in influenza virus infections is caused by a virus-induced cytopathy; viruses that have multiplied in the upper respiratory tract spread to lung tissues along the lower respiratory tract. However, some experimental and clinical studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of acute lung injury in influenza virus infections is associated with excessive host response including a cell-mediated immune reaction. During the pandemic {H1N1} 2009 influenza {A} virus infections in {K}orea, we experienced a dramatic effect of immune-modulators (corticosteroids) on the patients with severe pneumonia who had significant respiratory distress at presentation and those who showed rapidly progressive pneumonia during oseltamivir treatment. We also found that the pneumonia patients treated with corticosteroids showed the lowest lymphocyte differential and that the severity of pneumonia was associated with the lymphocyte count at presentation. From our findings and previous experimental and clinical studies, we postulated that hyperactive immune cells ({T} cells) may be involved in the acute lung injury of influenza virus infections, using a hypothesis of 'protein homeostasis system'; the inducers of the cell-mediated immune response are initially produced at the primary immune sites by the innate immune system. These substances reach the lung cells, the main target organ, via the systemic circulation, and possibly the cells of other organs, including myocytes or central nerve system cells, leading to extrapulmonary symptoms (e.g., myalgia and rhabdomyolysis, and encephalopathy). To control these substances that may be possibly toxic to host cells, the adaptive immune reaction may be operated by immune cells, mainly lymphocytes. Hyperimmune reaction of immune cells produces higher levels of cytokines which may be associated with acute lung injury, and may be controlled by early use of immune-modulators. Early initiation and proper dosage of immune-modulators with antiviral agents for severe pneumonia patients may reduce morbidity and prevent progressive fatal pneumonia.},

In an attempt to understand the regulation of fibroblasts from areas of active human tissue fibrosis, we have developed an ex vivo model in which biopsies of scars from patients 6 weeks post thoracotomy were cultured. This model has been used to investigate whether interleukin-10 ({IL-10}) and triamcinolone acetonide modulate the expression of type {I} procollagen {mRNA} and protein. In situ hybridization and a quantitative competitive {RT-PCR} were used to measure type {I} procollagen {mRNA}. Type {I} procollagen protein was evaluated by immunochemistry. Viability of biopsies in culture using {3H-uridine} incorporation into {RNA} was observed to be $>$ 80\% for at least 96 hours. Following addition of either {IL-10} or triamcinolone acetonide there was a modest but significant decrease ($P < 0.05$) in type $I$ procollagen {mRNA} expression. Similarly, each agent added individually to biopsies reduced the proportion of cells staining positively for type {I} procollagen when compared to biopsies treated with medium alone ($P < 0.05$). These results extend in vitro data that {IL-10} and corticosteroids down-regulate collagen synthesis in skin fibroblast cell lines and suggest that this ex vivo model may offer a closer approximation to the post-operative scarring process when testing new therapeutic agents for reducing an over-exuberent fibrotic response.},

In the present study, we characterized in detail the nuclear transport inhibitory properties of ivermectin, demonstrating that it is a broad-spectrum inhibitor of importin $\alpha$/$\beta$ nuclear import, with no effect on a range of other nuclear import pathways, including that mediated by importin $\beta$1 alone. Importantly, we establish for the first time that ivermectin has potent antiviral activity towards both {HIV}-1 and dengue virus, both of which are strongly reliant on importin $\alpha$/$\beta$ nuclear import, with respect to the {HIV}-1 integrase and {NS5} (non-structural protein 5) polymerase proteins respectively. Ivermectin would appear to be an invaluable tool for the study of protein nuclear import, as well as the basis for future development of antiviral agents.},

  abstract  = {{RNA} virus infections can lead to the onset of severe diseases such as fever with haemorrhage, multiorgan failure, and mortality. The emergence and reemergence of {RNA} viruses continue to pose a significant public health threat worldwide with particular attention to the increasing incidence of flaviviruses, among others Dengue, West Nile Virus, and Yellow Fever viruses. Development of new and potent antivirals is thus urgently needed. Ivermectin, an already known antihelminthic drug, has shown potent effects in vitro on Flavivirus helicase, with {EC50} values in the subnanomolar range for Yellow Fever and submicromolar {EC50} for Dengue Fever, Japanese encephalitis, and tick-borne encephalitis viruses. However ivermectin is hampered in its application by pharmacokinetic problems (little solubility and high cytotoxicity). To overcome such problems we engineered different compositions of liposomes as ivermectin carriers characterizing and testing them on several cell lines for cytotoxicity. The engineered liposomes were less cytotoxic than ivermectin alone and they showed a significant increase of the antiviral activity in all the Dengue stains tested (1, 2, and {S221}). In the current study ivermectin is confirmed to be an effective potential antiviral and liposomes, as drug carriers, are shown to modulate the drug activity. All together the results represent a promising starting point for future improvement of ivermectin as antiviral and its delivery.},

Two classes of conventional antivirals, {M2} ion channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors, are mainstays in managing influenza disease to lessen symptoms while minimizing hospitalization and death in patients with severe influenza. However, the development of viral resistance to both drug classes has become a major public health concern. Vaccines are prophylaxis mainstays but are limited in efficacy due to the difficulty in matching predicted dominant viral strains to circulating strains. As such, other potential interventions are being explored. Since viruses rely on host cellular functions to replicate, recent therapeutic developments focus on targeting host factors involved in virus replication. Besides controlling virus replication, potential targets for drug development include controlling virus-induced host immune responses such as the recently suggested involvement of innate lymphoid cells and {NADPH} oxidases in influenza virus pathogenesis and immune cell metabolism.

  abstract  = {Coronaviruses can cause respiratory and enteric disease in a wide variety of human and animal hosts. The 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome ({SARS}) first demonstrated the potentially lethal consequences of zoonotic coronavirus infections in humans. In 2012, a similar previously unknown coronavirus emerged, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ({MERS-CoV}), thus far causing over 650 laboratory-confirmed infections, with an unexplained steep rise in the number of cases being recorded over recent months. The human {MERS} fatality rate of 30\% is alarmingly high, even though many deaths were associated with underlying medical conditions. Registered therapeutics for the treatment of coronavirus infections are not available. Moreover, the pace of drug development and registration for human use is generally incompatible with strategies to combat emerging infectious diseases. Therefore, we have screened a library of 348 {FDA}-approved drugs for anti-{MERS-CoV} activity in cell culture. If such compounds proved sufficiently potent, their efficacy might be directly assessed in {MERS} patients. We identified four compounds (chloroquine, chlorpromazine, loperamide, and lopinavir) inhibiting {MERS-CoV} replication in the low-micromolar range (50\% effective concentrations [{EC50s}], 3 to 8 $\mu$M). Moreover, these compounds also inhibit the replication of {SARS} coronavirus and human coronavirus {229E}. Although their protective activity (alone or in combination) remains to be assessed in animal models, our findings may offer a starting point for treatment of patients infected with zoonotic coronaviruses like {MERS-CoV}. Although they may not necessarily reduce viral replication to very low levels, a moderate viral load reduction may create a window during which to mount a protective immune response.},

With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is also an important cause of death. Therefore, the treatment of cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe patients. Interleukin-6 ({IL-6}) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome ({CRS}). If it can block the signal transduction pathway of {IL-6}, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe patients. Tocilizumab is a blocker of {IL-6R}, which can effectively block {IL-6} signal transduction pathway. So, tocilizumab is likely to become an effective drug for patients with severe {COVID-19}.},

  abstract  = {Severe {COVID-19} associated pneumonia patients may exhibit features of systemic hyper-inflammation designated under the umbrella term of macrophage activation syndrome ({MAS}) or cytokine storm, also known as secondary haemophagocytic lymphohistocytosis ({sHLH}). This is distinct from {HLH} associated with immunodeficiency states termed primary {HLH}---with radically different therapy strategies in both situations. {COVID-19} infection with {MAS} typically occurs in subjects with adult respiratory distress syndrome ({ARDS}) and historically, non-survival in {ARDS} was linked to sustained {IL-6} and {IL-1} elevation. We provide a model for the classification of {MAS} to stratify the {MAS}-like presentation in {COVID-19} pneumonia and explore the complexities of discerning {ARDS} from {MAS}. We discuss the potential impact of timing of anti-cytokine therapy on viral clearance and the impact of such therapy on intra-pulmonary macrophage activation and emergent pulmonary vascular disease.},

We performed an integrative proteo-transcriptomics analysis in {SARS-CoV-2} infected {HuH7} cells to map the cellular response to the invading virus over time. We identified four pathways, {ErbB}, {HIF-1}, {mTOR} and {TNF} signaling, among others that were markedly modulated during the course of the {SARS-CoV-2} infection in vitro. Western blot validation of the downstream effector molecules of these pathways revealed a significant reduction in activated {S6K1} and {4E-BP1} at 72 hours post infection. Unlike other human respiratory viruses, we found a significant inhibition of {HIF-1$\alpha$} through the entire time course of the infection, suggesting a crosstalk between the {SARS-CoV-2} and the {mTOR/HIF-1} signaling. Further investigations are required to better understand the molecular sequelae in order to guide potential therapy in the management of severe {COVID-19} patients.},

  year        = {2012},
  abstract    = {Machine learning algorithms frequently require careful tuning of model hyperparameters, regularization terms, and optimization parameters. Unfortunately, this tuning is often a "black art" that requires expert experience, unwritten rules of thumb, or sometimes brute-force search. Much more appealing is the idea of developing automatic approaches which can optimize the performance of a given learning algorithm to the task at hand. In this work, we consider the automatic tuning problem within the framework of Bayesian optimization, in which a learning algorithm's generalization performance is modeled as a sample from a Gaussian process (GP). The tractable posterior distribution induced by the GP leads to efficient use of the information gathered by previous experiments, enabling optimal choices about what parameters to try next. Here we show how the effects of the Gaussian process prior and the associated inference procedure can have a large impact on the success or failure of Bayesian optimization. We show that thoughtful choices can lead to results that exceed expert-level performance in tuning machine learning algorithms. We also describe new algorithms that take into account the variable cost (duration) of learning experiments and that can leverage the presence of multiple cores for parallel experimentation. We show that these proposed algorithms improve on previous automatic procedures and can reach or surpass human expert-level optimization on a diverse set of contemporary algorithms including latent Dirichlet allocation, structured SVMs and convolutional neural networks.},

  abstract    = {Many different machine learning algorithms exist; taking into account each algorithm's hyperparameters, there is a staggeringly large number of possible alternatives overall. We consider the problem of simultaneously selecting a learning algorithm and setting its hyperparameters, going beyond previous work that addresses these issues in isolation. We show that this problem can be addressed by a fully automated approach, leveraging recent innovations in Bayesian optimization. Specifically, we consider a wide range of feature selection techniques (combining 3 search and 8 evaluator methods) and all classification approaches implemented in WEKA, spanning 2 ensemble methods, 10 meta-methods, 27 base classifiers, and hyperparameter settings for each classifier. On each of 21 popular datasets from the UCI repository, the KDD Cup 09, variants of the MNIST dataset and CIFAR-10, we show classification performance often much better than using standard selection/hyperparameter optimization methods. We hope that our approach will help non-expert users to more effectively identify machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter settings appropriate to their applications, and hence to achieve improved performance.},

Previous PBT implementations have been synchronized glass-box systems. We propose a general, black-box PBT framework that distributes many asynchronous "trials" (a small number of training steps with warm-starting) across a cluster, coordinated by the PBT controller. The black-box design does not make assumptions on model architectures, loss functions or training procedures. Our system supports dynamic hyperparameter schedules to optimize both differentiable and non-differentiable metrics. We apply our system to train a state-of-the-art WaveNet generative model for human voice synthesis. We show that our PBT system achieves better accuracy, less sensitivity and faster convergence compared to existing methods, given the same computational resource.},

  abstract    = {Neural network based data-driven market simulation unveils a new and flexible way of modelling financial time series without imposing assumptions on the underlying stochastic dynamics. Though in this sense generative market simulation is model-free, the concrete modelling choices are nevertheless decisive for the features of the simulated paths. We give a brief overview of currently used generative modelling approaches and performance evaluation metrics for financial time series, and address some of the challenges to achieve good results in the latter. We also contrast some classical approaches of market simulation with simulation based on generative modelling and highlight some advantages and pitfalls of the new approach. While most generative models tend to rely on large amounts of training data, we present here a generative model that works reliably in environments where the amount of available training data is notoriously small. Furthermore, we show how a rough paths perspective combined with a parsimonious Variational Autoencoder framework provides a powerful way for encoding and evaluating financial time series in such environments where available training data is scarce. Finally, we also propose a suitable performance evaluation metric for financial time series and discuss some connections of our Market Generator to deep hedging.},

  abstract    = {In recent years, multi-armed bandit (MAB) framework has attracted a lot of attention in various applications, from recommender systems and information retrieval to healthcare and finance, due to its stellar performance combined with certain attractive properties, such as learning from less feedback. The multi-armed bandit field is currently flourishing, as novel problem settings and algorithms motivated by various practical applications are being introduced, building on top of the classical bandit problem. This article aims to provide a comprehensive review of top recent developments in multiple real-life applications of the multi-armed bandit. Specifically, we introduce a taxonomy of common MAB-based applications and summarize state-of-art for each of those domains. Furthermore, we identify important current trends and provide new perspectives pertaining to the future of this exciting and fast-growing field.},

  abstract    = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Using the same learning algorithm, network architecture and hyper-parameters, our algorithm robustly solves more than 20 simulated physics tasks, including classic problems such as cartpole swing-up, dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion and car driving. Our algorithm is able to find policies whose performance is competitive with those found by a planning algorithm with full access to the dynamics of the domain and its derivatives. We further demonstrate that for many of the tasks the algorithm can learn policies end-to-end: directly from raw pixel inputs.},

  abstract    = {Model-free reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a range of challenging problems, and has recently been extended to handle large neural network policies and value functions. However, the sample complexity of model-free algorithms, particularly when using high-dimensional function approximators, tends to limit their applicability to physical systems. In this paper, we explore algorithms and representations to reduce the sample complexity of deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. We propose two complementary techniques for improving the efficiency of such algorithms. First, we derive a continuous variant of the Q-learning algorithm, which we call normalized adantage functions (NAF), as an alternative to the more commonly used policy gradient and actor-critic methods. NAF representation allows us to apply Q-learning with experience replay to continuous tasks, and substantially improves performance on a set of simulated robotic control tasks. To further improve the efficiency of our approach, we explore the use of learned models for accelerating model-free reinforcement learning. We show that iteratively refitted local linear models are especially effective for this, and demonstrate substantially faster learning on domains where such models are applicable.},

  abstract    = {We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically).

  abstract    = {Being able to reason in an environment with a large number of discrete actions is essential to bringing reinforcement learning to a larger class of problems. Recommender systems, industrial plants and language models are only some of the many real-world tasks involving large numbers of discrete actions for which current methods are difficult or even often impossible to apply. An ability to generalize over the set of actions as well as sub-linear complexity relative to the size of the set are both necessary to handle such tasks. Current approaches are not able to provide both of these, which motivates the work in this paper. Our proposed approach leverages prior information about the actions to embed them in a continuous space upon which it can generalize. Additionally, approximate nearest-neighbor methods allow for logarithmic-time lookup complexity relative to the number of actions, which is necessary for time-wise tractable training. This combined approach allows reinforcement learning methods to be applied to large-scale learning problems previously intractable with current methods. We demonstrate our algorithm's abilities on a series of tasks having up to one million actions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper we describe a new mobile architecture, MobileNetV2, that improves the state of the art performance of mobile models on multiple tasks and benchmarks as well as across a spectrum of different model sizes. We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC image segmentation. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as the number of parameters},

However, the \emph{direct} metric, e.g., speed, also depends on the other factors such as memory access cost and platform characterics. Thus, this work proposes to evaluate the direct metric on the target platform, beyond only considering FLOPs. Based on a series of controlled experiments, this work derives several practical \emph{guidelines} for efficient network design. Accordingly, a new architecture is presented, called \emph{ShuffleNet V2}. Comprehensive ablation experiments verify that our model is the state-of-the-art in terms of speed and accuracy tradeoff.},

  year        = {2017},
  abstract    = {The central building block of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is the convolution operator, which enables networks to construct informative features by fusing both spatial and channel-wise information within local receptive fields at each layer. A broad range of prior research has investigated the spatial component of this relationship, seeking to strengthen the representational power of a CNN by enhancing the quality of spatial encodings throughout its feature hierarchy. In this work, we focus instead on the channel relationship and propose a novel architectural unit, which we term the "Squeeze-and-Excitation" (SE) block, that adaptively recalibrates channel-wise feature responses by explicitly modelling interdependencies between channels. We show that these blocks can be stacked together to form SENet architectures that generalise extremely effectively across different datasets. We further demonstrate that SE blocks bring significant improvements in performance for existing state-of-the-art CNNs at slight additional computational cost. Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks formed the foundation of our ILSVRC 2017 classification submission which won first place and reduced the top-5 error to 2.251%, surpassing the winning entry of 2016 by a relative improvement of ~25%.

  abstract    = {We present the next generation of MobileNets based on a combination of complementary search techniques as well as a novel architecture design. MobileNetV3 is tuned to mobile phone CPUs through a combination of hardware-aware network architecture search (NAS) complemented by the NetAdapt algorithm and then subsequently improved through novel architecture advances. This paper starts the exploration of how automated search algorithms and network design can work together to harness complementary approaches improving the overall state of the art. Through this process we create two new MobileNet models for release: MobileNetV3-Large and MobileNetV3-Small which are targeted for high and low resource use cases. These models are then adapted and applied to the tasks of object detection and semantic segmentation. For the task of semantic segmentation (or any dense pixel prediction), we propose a new efficient segmentation decoder Lite Reduced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (LR-ASPP). We achieve new state of the art results for mobile classification, detection and segmentation. MobileNetV3-Large is 3.2\% more accurate on ImageNet classification while reducing latency by 15\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Small is 4.6\% more accurate while reducing latency by 5\% compared to MobileNetV2. MobileNetV3-Large detection is 25\% faster at roughly the same accuracy as MobileNetV2 on COCO detection. MobileNetV3-Large LR-ASPP is 30\% faster than MobileNetV2 R-ASPP at similar accuracy for Cityscapes segmentation.},

  year        = {2020},
  abstract    = {Systematic financial trading strategies account for over 80% of trade volume in equities and a large chunk of the foreign exchange market. In spite of the availability of data from multiple markets, current approaches in trading rely mainly on learning trading strategies per individual market. In this paper, we take a step towards developing fully end-to-end global trading strategies that leverage systematic trends to produce superior market-specific trading strategies. We introduce QuantNet: an architecture that learns market-agnostic trends and use these to learn superior market-specific trading strategies. Each market-specific model is composed of an encoder-decoder pair. The encoder transforms market-specific data into an abstract latent representation that is processed by a global model shared by all markets, while the decoder learns a market-specific trading strategy based on both local and global information from the market-specific encoder and the global model. QuantNet uses recent advances in transfer and meta-learning, where market-specific parameters are free to specialize on the problem at hand, whilst market-agnostic parameters are driven to capture signals from all markets. By integrating over idiosyncratic market data we can learn general transferable dynamics, avoiding the problem of overfitting to produce strategies with superior returns. We evaluate QuantNet on historical data across 3103 assets in 58 global equity markets. Against the top performing baseline, QuantNet yielded 51% higher Sharpe and 69% Calmar ratios. In addition we show the benefits of our approach over the non-transfer learning variant, with improvements of 15% and 41% in Sharpe and Calmar ratios. Code available in appendix.},

  abstract      = {This paper develops a deep learning method for linear and nonlinear filtering. The idea is to start with a nominal dynamic model and generate Monte Carlo sample paths. Then these samples are used to train a deep neutral network. A least square error is used as a loss function for network training. Then the resulting weights are applied to Monte Carlo sampl\ es from an actual dynamic model. The deep filter obtained in such a way compares favorably to the traditional Kalman filter in linear cases and the extended Kalman filter in nonlinear cases. Moreover, a switching model with jumps is studied to show the adaptiveness and power of our deep filtering method. A main advantage of deep filtering is its robustness when the nominal model and actual model differ. Another advantage of deep filtering is that real data can be used directly to train the deep neutral network. Therefore, one does not need to calibrate the model.},

  abstract      = {We study the interplay between memorization and generalization of overparameterized networks in the extreme case of a single training example and an identity-mapping task. We examine fully-connected and convolutional networks (FCN and CNN), both linear and nonlinear, initialized randomly and then trained to minimize the reconstruction error. The trained networks stereotypically take one of two forms: the constant function (memorization) and the identity function (generalization). We formally characterize generalization in single-layer FCNs and CNNs. We show empirically that different architectures exhibit strikingly different inductive biases. For example, CNNs of up to 10 layers are able to generalize from a single example, whereas FCNs cannot learn the identity function reliably from 60k examples. Deeper CNNs often fail, but nonetheless do astonishing work to memorize the training output: because CNN biases are location invariant, the model must progressively grow an output pattern from the image boundaries via the coordination of many layers. Our work helps to quantify and visualize the sensitivity of inductive biases to architectural choices such as depth, kernel width, and number of channels.},
