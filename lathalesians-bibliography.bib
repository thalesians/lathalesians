It follows that every bounded and continuous valuation on a continuous domain can be extended uniquely to a Borel measure. The result also holds for $\sigma$-finite valuations, but fails for dcpo's in general.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to measurement uncertainty, often, instead of the actual values $x_i$ of the measured quantities, we only know the intervals $\mathbf{x}_i = [\widetilde{x}_i - \Delta_i, \widetilde{x}_i + \Delta_i]$, where $\widetilde{x}_i$ is the measured value and $\Delta_i$ is the upper bound on the measurement error (provided, e.g., by the manufacturer of the measuring instrument). These intervals can be viewed as \emph{random intervals}, i.e., as samples from the interval-valued random variable. In such situations, instead of the exact value of the sample statistics such as covariance $C_{x, y}$, we can only have an interval $\mathbf{C}_{x, y}$ of possible values of this statistic. It is known that in general, computing such an interval $\mathbf{C}_{x, y}$ for $C_{x, y}$ is an NP-hard problem. In this paper, we describe an algorithm that computes this range $\mathbf{C}_{x, y}$ for the case when the measurements are accurate enough --- so that the intervals corresponding to different measurements do not intersect much.},

Probability and Measure provides thorough coverage of probability, measure, integration, random variables and expected values, convergence of distributions, derivatives and conditional probability, and stochastic processes. The Third Edition features an improved treatment of Brownian motion and the replacement of queuing theory with ergodic theory.
Like the previous editions, this new edition will be well received by students of mathematics, statistics, economics, and a wide variety of disciplines that require a solid understanding of probability theory.},

Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of default.},

  Abstract                 = {Two groups of naturally arising questions in the mathematical theory of domains for denotational semantics are addressed. Domains are equipped with Scott topology and represent data types. Scott continuous functions represent computable functions and form the most popular continuous model of computations.
Covariant Logic of Domains: Domains are represented as sets of theories, and Scott continuous functions are represented as input-output inference engines. The questions addressed are: A. What constitutes a subdomain? Do subdomains of a given domain A form a domain? B. Which retractions are finitary? C. What is the essence of generalizations of information systems based on non-reflexive logics? Are these generalizations restricted to continuous domains?
Analysis on Domains: D. How to describe Scott topologies via generalized distance functions satisfying the requirement of Scott continuity (``abstract computability'')? The answer is that the axiom $\rho(x, x) = 0$ is incompatible with Scott continuity of distance functions. The resulting relaxed metrics are studied.
E. Is it possible to obtain Scott continuous relaxed metrics via measures of domain subsets representing positive and negative information about domain elements? The positive answer is obtained via the discovery of the novel class of co-continuous valuations on the systems of Scott open sets.
Some of these natural questions were studied earlier. However, in each case a novel approach is presented, and the answers are supplied with much more compelling and clear justifications, than were known before.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the nonlinear filtering problem for a general Markovian partially observed system (X,Y), whose dynamics is modeled by correlated jump-diffusions having common jump times. At any time t, the sigma-algebra generated by the observation process Y provides all the available information about the signal X. The central goal of stochastic filtering is to characterize the filter which is the conditional distribution of X, given the observed data. It has been proved in Ceci-Colaneri (2012) that the filter is the unique probability measure-valued process satisfying a nonlinear stochastic equation, the so-called Kushner-Stratonovich equation (KS-equation). In this paper the aim is to describe the filter in terms of the unnormalized filter, which is solution to a linear stochastic differential equation, called the Zakai equation. We prove equivalence between strong uniqueness for the solution to the Kushner Stratonovich equation and strong uniqueness for the solution to the Zakai one and, as a consequence, we deduce pathwise uniqueness for the solutions to the Zakai equation by applying the Filtered Martingale Problem approach (Kurtz-Ocone (1988), Kurtz-Nappo (2011), Ceci-Colaneri (2012)). To conclude, we discuss some particular cases.},

This class includes recent approximations such as Kusuoka's moment similar families method and the Lyons-Victoir cubature of Wiener Space approach. We show that the rate of convergence depends intrinsically on the smoothness of the chosen test function. For smooth functions (the required degree of smoothness depends on the order of the approximation), an equidistant partition of the time interval on which the approximation is sought is optimal. For functions that are less smooth (for example Lipschitz functions), the rate of convergence decays and the optimal partition is no longer equidistant. Our analysis rests upon Kusuoka-Stroock's results on the smoothness of the distribution of the solution of a stochastic differential equation. Finally the results are applied to the numerical solution of the filtering problem.},

Depending on the intrinsic dimension of the noise, we distinguish two cases: In the first case, the conditional distribution has discrete support and we deduce an explicit representation for the conditional distribution. In the second case, the filtering problem is equivalent to a classical one defined on a manifold and we deduce the evolution equaion of the conditional distribution.

An interval number is used to capture, in a relatively simple manner, features of fuzziness and incompleteness. The vertex method is used for the interval analysis. A new parameter (also an interval number), $\rho$, called the degree of dependence is introduced. The relationship of this interval probability with the theories of Dempster-Shafer, fuzzy sets, and Baldwin's support logic are discussed. The advantage of the theory is that is is based on a development of the axioms of probability, but allows that evidential support for a conjecture be separated from evidential support for the negation of the conjecture.},

  Abstract                 = {What can computers do in principle? What are their inherent theoretical limitations? These are questions to which computer scientists must address themselves. The theoretical framework which enables such questions to be answered has been developed over the last fifty years from the idea of a computable function: intuitively a function whose values can be calcululated in an effective or automatic way.
This book is an introduction to computability theory (or recursion theory as it is traditionally known to mathematicians). Dr.~Cutland begins with a mathematical characterisation of computable functions (a register machine); after some comparison with other characterisations, he develops the mathematical theory, including a full discussion of non-computability and undecidability, and the theory of recursive and recursively enumerable sets.
The later chapters provide an introduction to more advanced topics such as G\"{o}del's incompleteness theorem, degrees of unsolvability, the Recursion theorems and the theory of complexity of computation. Computability is thus a branch of mathematics which is of relevance also to computer scientists and philosophers. Mathematics students with no prior knowledge of the subject and computer science students who wish to supplement their practical expertise with some theoretical background will find this book of use and interest.},

  Abstract                 = {An element of an effectively given domain is computable iff its basic Scott open neighbourhoods are recursively enumerable. We thus refer to computable elements as Scott computable and define an element to be Lawson computable if its basic Lawson open neighbourhoods are recursively enumerable. Since the Lawson topology is finer than the Scott topology, a stronger notion of computability is obtained. For example, in the powerset of the natural numbers with its standard effective presentation, an element is Scott computable iff it is a recursively enumerable set, and it is Lawson computable iff it is a recursive set. Among other examples, we consider the upper powerdomain of Euclidean space, for which we prove that Scott and Lawson computability coincide with two notions of computability for compact sets recently proposed by Brattka and Weihrauch in the framework of type-two recursion theory.},

For a discrete dynamical system given by the action of a continuous map $f: X \rightarrow X$ on a metric space $X$, we study the extended dynamical systems $(VX, Vf), (UX, Uf)$ and $(LX, Lf)$ where $V$, $U$ and $L$ are respectively the Vietoris hyperspace, the upper hyperspace and the lower hyperspace functors. We show that if $(X, f)$ is chaotic, then so is $(UX, Uf)$. When $X$ is locally compact, $UX$ is a continuous bounded complete dcpo. If $X$ is second countable as well, then $UX$ will be $\omega$-continuous and can be given an effective structure. We show how strange attractors, attractors of iterated function systems (fractals) and Julia sets are obtained effectively as fixed points of deterministic functions on $UX$ or fixed points of non-deterministic functions on $CUX$ where $C$ is the convex (Plotkin) power domain. We also show that the set $M(X)$ of finite Borel measures on $X$ can be embedded in $PUX$, where $P$ is the probabilistic power domain. This provides an effective framework for measure theory. We then prove that the invariant measure of an hyperbolic iterated function system with probabilities can be obtained as the unique fixed point of an associated continuous function on $PUX$.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a domain-theoretic framework for measure theory and integration of bounded real-valued functions with respect to bounded Borel measures on compact metric spaces. The set of normalised Borel measures of the metric space can be embedded into the maximal elements of the normalised probabilistic power domain of its upper space. Any bounded Borel measure on the compact metric space can then be obtained as the least upper bound of an $\omega$-chain of linear combinations of point valuations (simple valuations) of the upper space, thus providing a constructive setup for these measures. We use this setting to define a new notion of integral of a bounded real-valued function with respect to a bounded Borel measure of a compact metric space. By using an $\omega$-chain of simple valuations, whose lub is the guven Borel measure, we can then obtain increasingly better approximations to the value of the integral, similar to the way the Riemann integral is obtained in calculus by using step functions. We show that all the basic results in the theory of Riemann integration can be extended to this more general setting. Furthermore, with this new notion of integration, the value of the integral, when it exists, coincides with the Lebesgue integral of the function. An immediate area for application is in the theory of iterated function systems with probabilities on compact metric spaces, where we obtain a simple approximating sequence for the integral of a real-valued continuous function with respect to the invariant measure.},

This leads to various formulas and algorithms to compute the expected values of functions which are continuous almost everywhere with respect to the distribution of the stochastic process.

We show that whenever a separable metric space is homeomorphic to a $G_{\delta}$ subset of an $\omega$-continuous dcpo equipped with its Scott topology, the space of probability measures of the metric space equipped with the weak topology is homeomorphic with a subset of the maximal elements of the probabilistic power domain of the $\omega$-continuous dcpo. Given an effective approximation of a probability measure by an increasing chain of normalised valuations on the upper space of a compact metric space, we show that the expected value of any H\"{o}lder continuous function on the space can be obtained up to any given accuracy. We present a novel application in computing integrals in dynamical systems. We obtain an algorithm to compute the expected value of any H\"{o}lder continuous function with respect to the unique invariant measure of the Feigenbaum map in the periodic doubling route to chaos.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, there has been a considerable amount of work on using continuous domains in real analysis. Most notably are the the development of the generalized Riemann integral with applications in fractal geometry, several extensions of the programming language PCF with a real number data type, and a framework and an implementation of a package for exact real number arithmetic.
Based on recursion theory we present here a precise and direct formulation of effective representation of real numbers by continuous domains, which is equivalent to the representation of real numbers by algebraic domains as in the work of Stoltenberg-Hansen and Tucker.
We use basic ingredients of an effective theory of continuous domains to spell out notions of computability for the reals and for functions on the real line. We prove directly that our approach is equivalent to the established Turing-machine based approach which dates back to Grzegorczyk and Lacombe, is used by Pour-El and Richards in their foundational work on computable analysis, and, moreover, is the standard notion of computability among physicists as in the work of Penrose. Our framework makes it possible to capture partial functions in an elegant way and it extends to the complex numbers and the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space.},

This property holds for various full subcategories, including that of families of Markov processes on locally compact second countable spaces, and in the larger category where the objects are families of Markov processes on analytic spaces and morphisms are transition probability preserving surjective Borel maps. It also follows that the category of probability measures on Polish spaces and measure-preserving continuous surjective maps has semi-pullbacks. A main consequence of our result is that probabilistic bisimulation for labelled Markov processes on all these categories, defined in terms of spans of morphisms, is an equivalence relation.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a computable framework for Lebesgue's measure and integration theory in the spirit of domain theory. For an effectively given locally compact second countable Hausdorff space and an effectively given locally finite Borel measure on the space, we define the notion of a computable measurable set with respect to the given measure, which is stronger than Sanin's recursive measurable set. The set of computable measurable subsets is closed under complementation, finite unions and finite intersections. We then introduce interval-valued measurable functions and develop the notion of computable measurable functions using interval-valued simple functions. This leads us to the interval versions of the main results of the theory of Lebesgue integration which provide a computable framework for measure and integration theory. The Lebesgue integral of a computable integrable function with respect to an effectively given (\sigma-)finite Borel measure on an effectively given (locally) compact second countable Hausdorff space can be computed up to any required accuracy. We show that, with respect to the metric induced from the L^1 norm, the set of Scott continuous interval-valued functions is dense in the set of interval-valued integrable functions.},

  Abstract                 = {Here we describe and study the concept of an $f$-space, which is then used to determine a class $\mathbb{C}$ of partial (continuous) functionals of all finite types over an arbitrary complete $f$-space (in particular, over the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$). This class of functionals has a high degree of universality which makes it possible to compare various classes of functionals with each other (to determine the ``natural'' action of one class of functionals on another).
The class of functionals $\mathbb{C}$ is the greatest class on which the computable functionals of the class $\{\mathbb{F}_G \st G \in T\}$ naturally act. The class $\{\mathbb{F}_G \st G \in T\}$ is compared with the Kleene-Kreisel functionals.
The theory of computable partial functionals constructed here is a very natural extension of the familiar earlier theory of computable functionals of type [(010)10], although not so much from the point of view of the analysis of the concept of computability, but rather from the mathematical functional point of view. It is also important to note that this theory realizes the idea of constructing computable functionals of higher types starting from just the class of generally recursive functions.
It appears that this theory has some conceptual proximity with Scott's program for constructing a general mathematical program of computation. Unfortunately, we have only comparatively recently become acquainted with this paper and a later paper on the same theme, which has prevented explicit expression of the point of contact and the distance between these theories. It is only worth noting that it is the constructive (computational) aspect of Scott's theory which is least effectively realized in the subsequent publications. In his last article these connections are established more explicitly.
It should also be noted that some of the results in Sec.~7 on the solvability of the problem $P$ have been obtained (in other terms) independently by Chernov who also studied certain topological and constructive properties of the space $\{\Prob_G \st G \in T\}$, which are not studied in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {Synthetic topology as conceived in this monograph has three fundamental aspects:
\begin{enumerate} \item to explain what has been done in classical topology in conceptual terms, \item to provide one-line, enlightening proofs of the theorems that constitute the core of the theory, and \item to smoothly export topological concepts and theorems to unintended situations, keeping the synthetic proofs unmodified. \end{enumerate}
The unintended situation that we focus on is the theory of computation, in particular regarding programming languages from both operational (Part I) and denotational (Part III) points of view, with emphasis on sequential computation. We are aware of other applications of synthetic topology, e.g. to locales, convergence spaces, sequential spaces, equilogical spaces, and some sheaf and realizability toposes, but this will be reported elsewhere.
Aspects 1 and 2 are the subject of Part II. However, it turns out that it is possible to tackle aspect 3 without previous reference to 1 or 2. In fact, we start by developing synthetic topology of programming-language data types in Part I, without assuming any background in classical topology and without introducing any. Part III combines ideas from Parts I and II, developing non-trivial computational applications. The main new result is a computational version of the Tychonoff theorem. We also review previously known applications and explain how topology and semantics interact in program-correctness proofs.
Although computers are finite, infinity shows up in a number of important situations in the theory of computation, e.g. infinity in syntax: loops, recursion; infinity in time: non-terminating computations; infinity of data: stream computation and higher-type computation; infinity in precision: real-number computation; infinity through abstraction: probabilistic descriptions.
The first few chapters of Part I explore how the fundamental topological notions of continuous map, open set, closed set, compact set, Hausdorff space, and discrete space reconcile the finite character of computers with the infinite nature of the entities one wishes to calculate with. One of the main contributions of this monograph is to explain the computational nature of the the notion of compactness. Roughly speaking, a set is compact if and only if, given any semidecidable property, one can semidecide whether it holds for all elements of the set in finite time. Surprisingly, there are infinite computationally compact sets, for example that of infinite streams of binary digits.},

  Abstract                 = {There are two kinds of uncertainty. One kind arises as variability resulting from heterogeneity or stochasticity. The other arises as partial ignorance resulting from systematic measurement error or subjective (epistemic) uncertainty. As most researchers recognize, variability and ignorance should be treated separately in risk analyses. Although a second-order Monte Carlo simulation is commonly employed for this task, this approach often requires unjustified assumptions which may be inappropriate in some circumstances. We argue that the two kinds of uncertainty should be propagated through mathematical expressions with different calculation methods. Basically, interval analysis should be used to propagate ignorance, and probability theory should be used to propagate variability. We demonstrate how using an inappropriate method can yield erroneous results. We also show how ignorance and variability can be represented simultaneously and manipulated in a coherent analysis that does not confound the two forms of uncertainty and distinguishes what is known from what is assumed.},

  Abstract                 = {Continuous valuations have been proposed by several authors as a way of modelling probabilistic non-determinism in programming language semantics. Let $(X, {\cal O})$ be a topological space. A quasi-simple valuation on $X$ is the sup of a directed family of simple valuations. We show that quasi-simple valuations are exactly those valuations that extend to continuous valuations to the Alexandroff topology on the specialisation preordering of the topology $\cal O$. A number of applications are presented. In particular, we recover Jones' result that every continuous valuation is quasi-simple if $X$ is a continuous dcpo – in this case there is a least extension to the Alexandroff topology. We show that this can be refined if $X$ is algebraic, where every continuous valuation is the sup of a directed family of simple valuations based on finite elements. We exhibit another class of spaces in which every continuous valuation is quasi-simple, the so-called finitarily coherent spaces – in this case there is a largest extension to the Alexandroff topology. In general, the extension to the Alexandroff topology is not unique, unless, for example, the original valuation is bicontinuous. We also show that other natural spaces of valuations, namely those of discrete valuations and point-continuous valuations, can be characterised by similar extension theorems.},

It then provides a systematic introduction to probability theory, and in particular, those parts that are used in statistics. The Volume discusses the law of large numbers for independent and non-independent random variables, transforms, special distributions, convergence in law, the central limit theorem for normal and infinitely divisible laws, conditional expectations and martingales. Unusual topics include the uniqueness and convergence theorem for general transforms with characteristic functions, Laplace transforms, moment transforms and generating functions as special examples. The text contains substantive applications, e.g., epidemic models, the ballot problem, stock market models and water reservoir models, and a discussion of the historical background. The exercise sets contain a variety of problems ranging from simple exercises to extensions of the theory.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we generalize the construction of a domain-theoretic integral, introduced by Professor~Abbas~Edalat, in locally compact separable Hausdorff spaces, to general Hausdorff spaces embedded in a domain. Our main example of such spaces comprises general metric spaces embedded in the rounded ideal completion of the partially ordered set of formal balls. We go on to discuss analytic subsets of a general Hausdorff space, and give a sufficient condition for a measure supported on an analytic set to be approximated by a sequence of simple valuations. In particular, this condition is always satisfied in a metric space embedded in the rounded ideal completion of its formal ball space. We finish with a comments section, where we highlight some potential areas for future research and discuss some questions of computability.},

  Abstract                 = {We give a probabilistic powerdomain construction on the category of inductively complete partial orders; it is the partial order of continuous $[0, 1]$-valued evaluations on the Scott topology. By means of a theory of integration with respect to such evaluations, the powerdomain is shown to be a monad, and indeed one gets a model for Moggi's computational lambda-calculus. One can also solve recursive domain equations involving the powerdomain, and all this gives a meta-language for programming languages with probabilistic features. This is used to give the semantics of a language with a probabilistic parallel construct. We show the construction generalises previous work on partial orders of measures, and indeed restricts to the category of continuous partial orders, where it can be characterised as a free continuous finitary algebra.},

  Abstract                 = {Much of theoretical computer science is based on use of inductive complete partially ordered sets (or ipos). The aim of this thesis is to extend this successful theory to make it applicable to probabilistic computations. The method is to construct a ``probabilistic powerdomain'' on any ipo to represent the outcome of a probabilistic program which has outputs in the original ipo. In this thesis it is shown that evaluations (functions which assign a probability to open sets with various conditions) form such a powerdomain. Further, the powerdomain is a monadic functor on the category \textbf{Ipo}.
For restricted classes of ipos a powerdomain of probability distributions, or measures which only take values less than one, has been constructed (by Saheb-Djahromi). In this thesis we show that this powerdomain may be constructed for continuous ipos where it is isomorphic to that of evaluations.
The powerdomain of evaluations is shown to have a simple Stone type duality between it and sets of upper continuous functions. This is then used to give a Hoare style logic for an imperative probabilistic language, which is the dual of the probabilistic semantics.
Finally, the powerdomain is used to give a denotational semantics of a probabilistic metalanguage which is an extension of Moggi's $\lambda_c$-calculus for the powerdomain monad. The semantics is then shown to be equivalent to an operational semantics.},

It is written for readers familiar with measure-theoretic probability and discrete-time processes, who wish to explore stochastic processes in continuous time. The vehicle chosen for this exposition is Brownian motion, which is presented as the canonical example of both a martingale and a Markov process with continuous paths. In this context, the theory of stochastic integration and stochastic calculus is developed. The power of this calculus is illustrated by results concerning representations of martingales and change of measure on Wiener space, and these in turn permit a presentation of recent advances in financial economics (option pricing and consumption/investment optimization).
The book contains a detailed discussion of weak and strong solutions of stochastic differential equations and a study of local time for semimartingales, with special emphasis on the theory of Brownian local time. The text is complemented by a large number of problems and exercises.},

Due to their ability to model uncertainty, interval and soft computing techniques have been found to be effective in this extraction. This book provides coverage of the basic theoretical foundations for applying these techniques to artificial intelligence and knowledge processing.
The first three chapters provide the background needed for those who are unfamiliar with interval and soft computing techniques. The following chapters describe innovative algorithms and their applications to knowledge processing.
In particular, these chapters cover computing techniques for interval linear systems of equations, interval matrix singular-value decomposition, interval function approximation, and decision making with statistical and graph-based data processing. To enable these applications, the book presents a standards-based object-oriented interval computing environment in C++.
By providing the necessary background and summarizing recent results and successful applications, this self-contained book will serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners wanting to learn interval and soft computing techniques and apply them to artificial intelligence and knowledge processing.},

A general extension principle is derived that provides a unified approach to a variety of extension theorems including valuations that are directed suprema of simple valuations, continuous valuations on locally compact sober spaces, and regular valuations on coherent sober spaces.},

  Abstract                 = {It is the purpose of this monograph to develop probability theory from a postulational standpoint. For this purpose a probability field is defined as an assemblage with a definite ordering of numbers that satisfy the system of axioms. A brief exposition is given of the construction of such fields and of the manner in which the framework of the postulational system can be related to the applications to phenomena. The addition and multiplication theorems follow at once. Moreover, the theorem of Bayes, concerning whose validity there have been many controversies, is also an almost immediate consequence of the system of postulates, but the reviewer does not think this derivation of the theorem of Bayes settles the old contention relative to the validity of inferring the characteristics of a statistical population from a sample by means of the theorem of Bayes.
Use is made of the Lebesgue theories of measure and of integration. Indeed, it is held that it seemed almost hopeless to deal with the logical foundations of probability without these theories.
The development includes infinite probability fields by means of an additional axiom, distribution functions in space of many dimensions, differentiation and integration of mathematical expectations, and the law of large numbers. This little book seems to the reviewer to be an important contribution directed towards securing a more logical development of probability theory.},

  Abstract                 = {This volume in Richard Silverman's exceptional series of translations of Russian works in the mathematical sciences is a comprehensive, elementary introduction to real and functional analysis by two faculty members from Moscow University. It is self-contained, evenly paced, eminently readable, and readily accessible to those with adequate preparation in advanced calculus.
The first four chapters present basic concepts and introductory principles in set theory, metric spaces, topological spaces, and linear spaces. The next two chapters consider linear functionals and linear operators, with detailed discussions of continuous linear functionals, the conjugate space, the weak topology and weak convergence, generalized functions, basic concepts of linear operators, inverse and adjoint operators, and completely continuous operators. The final four chapters cover measure, integration, differentiation, and more on integration. Special attention is here given to the Lebesgue integral, Fubini's theorem, and the Stieltjes integral. Each individual section --- there are 37 in all --- is equipped with a problem set, making a total of some 350 problems, all carefully selected and matched.
With these problems and the clear exposition, this book is useful for self-study or for the classroom --- it is a basic one-year course in real analysis. Dr.~Silverman is a former member of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences of New York University and the Lincoln Library of M.I.T. Along with his translation, he has revised the text with numerous pedagogical and mathematical improvements and restyled the language so that it is even more readable.},

  Abstract                 = {An approach for a simple, general, and unified theory of effectivity on sets with cardinality not greater than that of the continuum is presented. A standard theory of effectivity on $\mathbb{F} = \{f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}\}$ has been developed in a previous paper. By representations $\delta: \mathbb{F} \rightarrow M$ this theory is extended to other sets $M$. Topological and recursion theoretical properties of representations are studied, where the final topology of a representation plays an essential role. It is shown that for any separable $T_0$-space an (up to equivalence) unique admissible representation can be defined which reflects the topological properties correctly.},

  Abstract                 = {What better guide could we have to the 2008 financial crisis and its resolution than the newest Nobel Laureate in Economics, columnist and author Paul Krugman?
In a dazzling and prescient polemic, now fully updated from his 1999 classic, Krugman shows how today's situation parallels the events that caused the Great Depression. He surveys the economic crises that swept across Asia, Russia and Latin America in the 1990s, and reveals that those crises were a warning for all of us. Now depression economics has returned: when the great housing bubble of the mid-2000s burst, the Western financial system proved as vulnerable as those of developing countries caught up in earlier crises --- and a replay of the 1930s seems all too plausible.
Krugman shows how it happened and lays out the steps that must be taken to turn around a world economy sliding into a deep recession. Brilliantly crafted in his trademark style --- lucid, lively, and supremely informed --- this will become a cornerstone of the debate over how to respond to our current economic predicament.},

  Abstract                 = {\emph{Elements of Operator Theory} is aimed at graduate students as well as a new generation of mathematicians and scientists who need to apply operator theory to their field. Written in a user-friendly, motivating style, fundamental topics are presented in a systematic fashion, i.e., set theory, algebraic structures, topological structures, Banach spaces, Hilbert spaces, culminating with the Spectral Theorem, one of the landmarks in the theory of operators on Hilbert spaces. The exposition is concept-driven and as much as possible avoids the formula-computational approach.
Key features of this largely self-contained work include:
\begin{itemize} \item required background material to each chapter \item fully rigorous proofs, over 300 of them, are specially tailored to the presentation and some are new \item more than 100 examples and, in several cases, interesting counterexamples that demonstrate the frontiers of an important theorem \item over 300 problems, many with hints \item both problems and examples underscore further auxiliary results and extensions of the main theory; in this non-traditional framework, the reader is challenged and has a chance to prove the pricnipal theorems anew \end{itemize}
This work is an excellent text for the classroom as well as a self-study resource for researchers. Prerequisites include an introduction to analysis and to functions of a complex variable, which most first-year graduate students in mathematics, engineering, or another formal science have already acquired. Measure theory and integration theory are required only for the last section of the final chapter.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper provides a general valuation method for the European options whose payoff is restricted by curved boundaries contractually set on the underlying asset price process when it follows the geometric Brownian motion. Our result is based on the generalization of the Levy formula on the Brownian motion by T. W. Anderson in sequential analysis. We give the explicit probability formula that the geometric Brownian motion reaches in an interval at the maturity date without hitting either the lower or the upper curved boundaries. Although the general pricing formulae for options with boundaries are expressed as infinite series in the general case, our numerical study suggests that the convergence of the series is rapid. Our results include the formulae for options with a lower boundary by Merton (1973), for path-dependent options by Goldman, Sossin, and Gatto (1979), and for some corporate securities as special cases.},

  Abstract                 = {The analysis of experimental data resulting from some underlying random process is a fundamental part of most scientific research. Probability Theory and Statistics have been developed as flexible tools for this analysis, and have been applied successfully in various fields such as Biology, Economics, Engineering, Medicine or Psychology. However, traditional techniques in Probability and Statistics were devised to model only a single source of uncertainty, namely randomness. In many real-life problems randomness arises in conjunction with other sources, making the development of additional ``softening'' approaches essential. This book is a collection of papers presented at the 2nd International Conference on Soft Methods in Probability and Statistics (SMPS'2004) held in Oviedo, providing a comprehensive overview of the innovative new research taking place within this emerging field.},

  Abstract                 = {Sampling from probability density functions (pdfs) has become more and more important in many areas of applied science, and has therefore been the subject of great attention. Many sampling procedures proposed allow for approximate or asymptotic sampling. On the other hand, very few methods allow for exact sampling. Direct sampling of standard pdfs is feasible, but sampling of much more complicated pdfs is often required. Rejection sampling allows to exactly sample from univatiate pdfs, but has the hige drawback of needing a case-by-case calculation of a comparison function that often reveals as a tremendous chore, whose results dramatically affect the efficiency of the sampling procedure. In this paper, we restrict ourselves to a pdf that is proportional to a product of standard distributions. From there, we show that an automated selection of both the comparison function and the upper bound is possible. Moreover, this choice is performed in order to optimize the sampling efficiency among a range of potential solutions. Finally, the method is illustrated on a few examples.},

In particular, $\ker\mu$ must be metrisable in its relative Scott topology. Moreover, the space $\ker\skew3\bar{\mu}$ in its relative Scott topology is homeomorphic to the Vietoris hyperspace of $\ker\mu$, that is, the space of non-empty compact subsets of $\ker\mu$ in its Vietoris topology – the topology induced by any Hausdorff metric. This enables one to show that Hutchinson's theorem holds for any finite set of contractions on a domain with a Lebesgue measurement. Finally, after resolving the existence question for Lebesgue measurements on countably based domains, we uncover the following relationship between classical analysis and domain theory: for an $\omega$-continuous dcpo $D$ with $\max(D)$ regular, the Vietoris hyperspace of $\max(D)$ embeds in $\max({\mathbf C} D)$ as the kernel of a measurement on ${\mathbf C} D$.},

  Abstract                 = {Highly regarded among mathematicians for its exceptional clarity, imaginative and instructive exercises, and fine writing style, this concise book offers an ideal introduction to the fundamentals of topology. Originally conceived as a text for a one-semester course, it is directed to undergraduate students whose studies of calculus sequence have included definitions and proofs of theorems. The book's principal aim is to provide a simple, thorough survey of elementary topics in the study of collections of objects, or sets, that possess a mathematical structure.
The author begins with an informal discussion of set theory in Chapter~1, reserving coverage of the concept of countability for Chapter~5, where it appears in the context of compactness. In the second chapter Professor~Mendelson discusses metric spaces, paying particular attention to various distance functions which may be defined on Euclidean $n$-space and which lead to the ordinary topology.
Chapter~3 takes up the concept of topological space, presenting it as a generalization of the concept of a metric space. Chapters~4 and 5 are devoted to a discussion of the two most important topological properties: connectedness and compactness. Throughout the text, Dr.~Mendelson, a former Professor of Mathematics at Smith College, has included many challenging and stimulating exercises to help students develop a solid grasp of the material presented.},

We present basic facts about weak and weak star topologies, dual spaces and representations of linear functionals as Radon measures. A special attention is payed to finitely additive measures and some results regarding the Baire sets. We prove that in a wide class of topological spaces (e.g. in non-compact metric spaces), the set of probability measures is not closed under weak star convergence, and we discuss measures in the closure. A classical theory of weak convergence of probability measures, including Prohorov's theorem is also presented. The second part of the paper is devoted to probability measures on separable Hilbert spaces. We discuss characteristic functions and its properties. The topic of weak compactness is studied assuming that a Hilbert space is equipped with the weak topology and with the norm topology separately. Here we also present a Prohorov's theorem on Hilbert spaces with the weak topology.},

  Abstract                 = {Stochastic geometry is a relatively new branch of mathematics. Although its predecessors such as geometric probability date back to the 18th century, the formal concept of a random set was developed in the beginning of the 1970s. \emph{Theory of Random Sets} presents a state-of-the-art treatment of the modern theory, but it does not neglect to recall and build on the foundations laid by Matheron and others, including the vast advances in stochastic geometry, probability theory, set-valued analysis, and statistical inference of the 1990s.
The book is entirely self-contained, systematic and exhaustive, with the full proofs that are necessary to gain insight. It shows the various interdisciplinary relationships of random set theory within other parts of mathematics, and at the same time, fixes terminology and notation that are often varying in the current literature to establish it as a natural part of modern probability theory, and to provide a platform for future development. An extensive, searchable bibliography to accompany the book is freely available via the Web.
This book will be an inbaluable reference for probabilists, mathematicians in convex and integral geometry, set-valued analysis, capacity and potential theory, mathematical statisticians in spatial statistics and image analysis, specialists in mathematical economics, and electronic and electrical engineers interested in image analysis.
Ilya Molchanov is Professor of Probability Theory in the Department of Mathematical Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Berne, Switzerland.},

Mutual relationships between the computability notion of a probability distribution and that of the corresponding distribution function are discussed. It is carried out through attempts to effectivize some classical fundamental theorems concerning probability distributions. We then define the effective convergence of probability distributions as an effectivization of the classical vague convergence. For distribution functions, computability and effective convergence are naturally defined as real functions. A weaker effective convergence is also defined as an effectivization of pointwise convergence.},

  abstract =  {This is a postgraduate level textbook, written specifically for use at universities in India and fills a long-felt need. It has several welcome features. Motivation and heuristic explanations are provided before introducing many of the concepts; bases and subbases of a topology are given more attention than most books do; both filters and nets are treated in great details, and there is also a discussion on the so-called equivalence of the two concepts; gives a detailed treatment of image and quotient topologies. Compactification is treated in far greater detail than any other book, with ample warnings about common pitfalls. The presentation of compactifications is rigorous and yet easier to understand. The chapter on Uniform Spaces proceeds at a pace that the student will find easier to handle. A large number and a broad spectrum of exercises are given at the end of each chapter. The introductory chapter has a list of over a hundred set-theoretic identities which the student should find very handy as a reference list. There is an extensive bibliography for the library-oriented student. An excellent index of keywords and another of notations make the job of searching and cross-referencing easy. The first edition and the subsequent revised edition of this book have been remarkably well received.},

A cloud is to a random variable more or less what an interval is to a number. We discuss the basic theoretical and numerical properties of clouds, and relate them to histograms, cumulative distribution functions, and likelihood ratios.
We show how to compute nonlinear transformations of clouds, using global optimization and contraint satisfaction techniques. We also show how to compute rigorous enclosures for the expectation of arbitrary functions of random variables, and for probabilities of arbitrary statements involving random variables, even for problems involving more than a few variables.
Finally, we relate clouds to concepts from fuzzy set theory, in particular to the consistent possibility and necessity measures of Jamison and Lodwick.},

The text begins with a discussion of the real number system as a complete ordered field. (Dedekind's construction is now treated in an appendix to Chapter I.) The topological background needed for the development of convergence, continuity, differentiation and integration is provided in Chapter 2. There is a new section on the gamma function, and many new and interesting exercises are included.

  Abstract                 = {In this approach to the semantics of nondeterminism, we introduce and study the complete partial order (cpo) of probability distributions on a domain. The approach avoids considering equivalent subsets, used in theory of powerdomains, which may lead to some unwelcome identifications. These results show that the class of probability distributions on a cpo is itself a cpo and that every probability distribution is the lub of an increasing sequence of ‘finite’ probability distributions. We introduce the probabilistic extensions of continuous functions in order to extend the ‘usual’ continuous functions on this new domain. On the other hand the structure of this cpo suggests introducing an operation called ‘random selection’, which is the counterpart of the ‘OR’ (or union) operation, commonly used in nondeterministic programs. The paper then studies the ‘naturalness’ of these extended notions and treats the question of continuity, which is of prime importance in the Scott theory of fixed point semantics.},

Given such a representation, we show that probabilistic processes on infinite words, under which each successive symbol is determined by a finite probabilistic choice, generate Borel probability measures on the represented space. Conversely, for several well-behaved types of space, every Borel probability measure is represented by a corresponding probabilistic process. Accordingly, we consider probabilistic processes as providing “probabilistic names” for Borel probability measures. We show that integration is computable with respect to the induced representation of measures.},

Such concepts as ``specifications'', ``predicate transformerr'', and ``nondeterminism'' can be greatly illuminated by being formulated in topological terms. The specific tasks we undertake are: to provide a more adequate framework for power-domain constructions; and to show that the connection between (Dijkstra's) weakest preconditions and the Smyth powerdomain, established by Plotkin for the case of flat domains, actually holds in full generality.},

  Year                     = {2001},

  Abstract                 = {In 1821 an inventor and mathematician, Charles Babbage, was poring over a set of mathematical tables. Finding error after error Babbage exclaimed, "I wish to God these calculations had been executed by steam." His frustration was not simply at the grindingly tedious labor of checking manually evaluated tables, but at their daunting unreliability. Science, engineering, construction, banking, and insurance depended on tables for calculation. Ships navigating by the stars relied on them to find their positions at sea.
Babbage launched himself on a grand venture to design and build mechanical calculating engines that would eliminate such errors. His bid to build infallible machines is a saga of ingenuity and will, which led beyond mechanized arithmetic into the entirely new realm of computing. Through Ada, Countess of Lovelace and daughter of Lord Byron, we gain tantalizing insights into how at least one Victorian glimpsed the promise of what was to come. Babbage springs out of history like a jack-in-the-box: a gentleman philosopher, a tireless inventor, a vigorous socialite, and a mesmerizing raconteur. "Mr. Babbage is coming to dinner" was a coup for any hostess.
Drawing on previously unused archival material, The Difference Engine is a tale of both Babbage's nineteenth-century quest to build a calculating engine and its twentieth-century sequel. For in 1991, Babbage's vision was finally realized, at least in part, by the completion at the Science Museum in London of the first full-sized Babbage engine, finished in time for the 200th anniversary of Babbage's birth. The two quests are mutually illuminating and are recounted here by the-then Curator of Computing, Doron Swade -- one of the main protagonists of the successful resumption of Babbage's extraordinary work.},

  Abstract                 = {While for countable sets there is a single well established computability theory (ordinary recursion theory), Computable Analysis is still underdeveloped. Several mutually non-equivalent theories have been proposed for it, none of which, however, has been accepted by the majority of mathematicians or computer scientists. In this contribution one of these theories, TTE (Type 2 Theorie of Effectivity), is presented, which at least in the author's opinion has important advantages over the others. TTE intends to characterize and study exactly those functions, operators etc. known from Analysis, which can be realized correctly by digital computers. The paper gives a short introduction to basic concepts of TTE and shows its general applicability by some selected examples. First, Turing computability is generalized from finite to infinite sequences of symbols. Assuming that digital computers can handle (w.l.o.g.) only sequences of symbols, infinite sequences of symbols are used as names for “infinite objects” such as real numbers, open sets, compact sets or continuous functions. Naming systems are called representations. Since only very few representations are of interest in applications, a very fundamental principle for defining effective representations for T0-spaces with countable bases is introduced. The concepts are applied to real numbers, open sets, compact sets and continuous functions. The problem of determining zeroes is considered. Computational complexity is discussed and computability in measure theory is sketched. The paper concludes with some remarks on other models for Computable Analysis.},

Are differentiation and integration computable operators? Is zero finding for complex polynomials computable? Is the Mandelbrot set decidable? And in case of computability, what is the computational complexity? Computable analysis supplies exact definitions for these and many other similar questions and tries to solve them.
Merging fundamental concepts of analysis and recursion theory to a new exciting theory, this book provides a solid fundament for studying various aspects of computability and complexity in analysis. It is the result of an introductory course given for several years and is written in a style suitable for graduate-level and senior students in computer science and mathematics. Many examples illustrate new concepts while numerous exercises of varying difficulty extend the material and stimulate readers to work actively on the text.},

He helps students build the intuition needed, in a presentation enriched with examples drawn from all manner of applications, e.g., genetics, filtering, the Black-Scholes option-pricing formula, quantum probability and computing, and classical and modern statistical models. Statistics chapters present both the Frequentist and Bayesian approaches, emphasising Confidence Intervals rather than Hypothesis Test, and include Gibbs-sampling techniques for the practical implementation of Bayesian methods. A central chapter gives the theory of Linear Regression and ANOVA, and explains how MCMC methods allow greater flexibility in modelling. C or WinBUGS code is provided for computational examples and simulations. Many exercises are included; hints or solutions are often provided.},

A Gaussian filter is approximation of the Bayesian inference with the Gaussian posterior probability density assumption being valid. There exists a variation of Gaussian filters in the literature that derived themselves from very different backgrounds. From the numerical-integration viewpoint, various versions of Gaussian filters are only distinctive from each other in their specific treatments of approximating the multiple statistical integrations. A common base is provided for the first time to analyze and compare Gaussian filters with respect to accuracy, efficiency and stability factor. This study is expected to facilitate the selection of appropriate Gaussian filters in practice and to help design more efficient filters by employing better numerical integration methods.},

Especially for interval-valued martingale we obtain several equivalent propositions based on measurable selections.

We prove that the set-valued stochastic integral becomes a set-valued submartingale, which is different from single valued case, and obtain the Castaing representation theorem for the set-valued stochastic integral, which is applicable for set-valued stochastic differential equations.},

  Abstract                 = {This two-volume work presents a thorough first course in analysis, leading from real numbers to such advanced topics as differential forms on manifolds, asymptotic methods, integral transforms, and distributions. Especially notable in this course is the clearly expressed orientation toward the natural sciences and its informal exploration of the essence and the roots of the basic concepts and theorems of calculus. Clarity of exposition is matched by a wealth of instructive exercises, problems and fresh applications to areas seldom touched on in real analysis books. The second volume expounds classical analysis as it is today, as a part of unified mathematics, and its interactions with modern mathematical courses such as algebra, differential geometry, differential equations, complex and functional analysis. The book provides a firm foundation for advanced work in any of these directions.},
