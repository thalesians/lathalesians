% txfonts must be required before mathpazo, and amsthm, should one decide to
% use it, must be required before txfonts. Therefore we shall require it here,
% just in case, to spare our users the confusion.
\RequirePackage{amsmath,amsthm,txfonts}

% txfonts introduces some domain theory symbols. We require this package here
% so that it doesn't matter whether this package is loaded before or after
% lathalesians-domains, since lathalesians-domains does not require mathpazo
% and can be used without lathalesians-font.

% Set Palatino font as default roman. Math in Palatino where possible:
\RequirePackage{mathpazo}

% From Wikipedia:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Palatino is the name of a large typeface family that began as an old style
% serif typeface designed by Hermann Zapf initially released in 1948 by the
% Linotype foundry. In 1999 Zapf revised Palatino for Linotype and Microsoft
% called Palatino Linotype. The revised family incorporated extended Latin,
% Greek, Cyrillic character sets.
%
% Under the collaboration of Zapf and Akira Kobayashi the Palatino typeface
% family was expanded. Linotype released the Palatino nova, Palatino Sans, and
% Palatino Sans Informal families, expanding the Palatino typeface families to
% include humanist sans-serif typefaces. Palatino nova was released in 2005,
% while the others were released in 2006.
%
% Named after 16th century Italian master of calligraphy Giambattista Palatino,
% Palatino is based on the humanist fonts of the Italian Renaissance, which
% mirror the letters formed by a broad nib pen; this gives a calligraphic grace.
% But where the Renaissance faces tend to use smaller letters with longer
% vertical lines (ascenders and descenders) with lighter strokes, Palatino has
% larger proportions, and is considered much easier to read.
%
% It remains one of the most widely-used (and copied) text typefaces, has been
% adapted to virtually every type of technology, and is one of the ten most used
% serif typefaces. It is one of several typefaces by Zapf, each showing
% influence of the Italian Renaissance letter forms. The group includes
% Palatine, Sistina, Michaelangelo tiling, and Aldus, which takes inspiration
% from printing types cut by Francesco Griffo c. 1495 in the print shop of Aldus
% Manutius.
